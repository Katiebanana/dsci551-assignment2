This document was signed by the late entertainer Paul Keith Wigeman, whose name was used with my late father for the deposit of the Ten Million  Dollars (US$10.5m) deposited in his bank by my late father. He died on the 26th of March 1995. My late father deposited the Five Million  Dollar deposit with a security company as the "WINNER OF THE WEEK" in the International Festival of Arts/Games (IFGG).The Security company told me that they have a new contractor I need your assistance to move this money through to your country. Also, to get this money out of my country, you will have to deposit it with a foreign bank account,so that the money will be transferred to your designated bank account for safe keeping.The way it works, it is as follows: the security company gives you a certificate of deposit released to you as the winners of the IFG GUIDE Award,in your country, and the consignment will be shipped to you. The consignment will be opened and secured for you by a trusted firm. The security company will go through the consignment and eventually conclude to move this money to a diplomatic country,but, as I am a foreigner, the chinese law does not permit the safe keeping of consignments by foreigners, therefore I need your assistance and your assistance to move this money through to your designated bank account. Please send me your telephone and fax numbers for easy communication. All you have to do is to forward to me the full details of the transaction. I will then open an account with your bank so that you can forward the content of the consignment to me, that you will be credited as the "WINNER OF THE WEEK" in the IFG GUIDE Award. Your response is highly needed for me to prepare an urgent and viable proposal, that will benefit both of us. Please assure me that you will not support such a proposal.

Please reply to me as soon as you found out.\r\nThank you for your co-operation.\r\nMr.James Moore.\r", "FROM MR JAMES MALAHO\nFROM MR JAMES MALAHO\nFROM MR JAMES MALAHO\nFROM MR JAMES MALAHO\nDES VOEUX, PARIS-ENERME\nATTENTION:\nNAME:CHARLES WILLIAMS\nDEAR SIR,\nI AM CHARLES WILLIAMS, THE MANAGER, DIVERTED DEPOSIT OF A NEW GLOBAL COMPANY PLC (THE COMPANY).

The Sturmabteilungsromanwulff.de website basically states that there is a foreign owner of this fund, Mr. Wolfgang Wulff. This foreigner died in July, 1999 at the age of 79, (all told, he made $12.3M USD) and we don't know what he did for the money, we don't know that this money is still sitting in the bank, he died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. We don't know why he died, we don't know why he died then, he deposited this money in a Security Bank in Amsterdam. This money was deposited in BANK OF AFRICA as a security deposit, only he died the moment it was deposited.(Note that the name of the security deposit is also changed to reflect that it was the responsibility of the bank owner of the deposit to not loose the money to the security company). What we want to do now is to claim the money and transfer it to a more reliable foreign account, so that the funds can be transferred to another Bank account. All we need is a reliable foreigner, and a reliable bank account in your country, we will invest the money in any profitable business that you will advise us about. \nWe will use the money to relocate to a safer country for investment, but we will not let you down either now or in future. \nAll i want you to do is to always remain honest to me. I am waiting with my lawyer so that you know the closing stages of this transaction.

Makonot, one of the major banks in South Africa and one of the world's largest private banking, is the target of a large international blackmail attack by an over-invoiced foreign partner. He has, in fact, claimed your funds, only to find out later that we have been frozen out of banking because of a cover-up for our involvement.The victim of this blackmail was one of the key officials in the private banking sector, Mr.Fredrick Smith. And we all know that the man over-invoiced can be reached.\nThere were numerous suggestions made for a credible foreign partner/s to carry out this operation, but have yet to receive any reply. This is because of the confidentiality of this transaction. In view of this, my suggestion is that I hope to advise you a deal that will be executed under legitimate arrangement from the top officials involved to enable us transfer the money out for investment into your country.This arrangement was hatched by the South Africa Government in the ECOMOBANKs investigation for the successful transfer of $25 million US dollars (twenty-five Million US dollars) into your account.\nThis fund was originally coded for a trade, and secretly the South African Government has been preparing to transfer it since the last political military government was overthrown in August 1999.\nThis transaction include immediate transfer of the money to a reliable foreign account where the funds will be stored for investment.The whole arrangement is very simple, you will provide me with the information needed to commence the transfer. There is no risk involved in this project as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.\nThe money in question was deposited in one of the private bank safe-deposit box with the International Security Company in South Africa, and the security guard has been instructed to follow up every communication that might come our way. I want you to stand in as the next of kin to the deceased, so that the fruit of this old man's labour will not get into the wrong hands again.\nThe fund now has to be transferred to your nominated bank account in your country where it can be transferred without undue risk of interest.\nThe finance company does have the authority to

However, I am aware of the consequences of this proposal and I will not sit on this as a blind desire to be involved in money laundering, but instead, I am seeking your assistance to take up and run a business with you as my foreign partner, so that the proceeds of this business can be paid into your account.\r\nI am looking forward to your earliest reply through the above email address.\r\nBest Regards,\r\nMrs Fatima F.

Metal and Steel picked out of the ground to make (metal and steel corrugated steel) through the years of oil crises and the embargo imposed by President Raul Castro. This crude can now be shipped to the United States for export into the products of genuine companies. It is now the long time hope of the Republic of Sierra Río that this project is successfully carried out and the government of President Luis M.Rodríguez who is to retire from service will release the money into the national treasury as a joint venture fund diamonds. The reason for this effort is to obtain and transfer the diamonds left behind by LADRADE PARTY ULC (The political arm of the Federal Republic of Sierra Río) which were deposited in an unknown company in my name. The money deposited is presently in the Security Company by the people of Sierra Río who have been waiting for my presence to back up their claims. I am not allowed to operate a Foreign Account or be a declared Cashholder in any of the transactions. To put this in perspective, the amount deposited was US$11.5 Million (Twelve Million United States Dollars) which is the "Country Dollar" which the Country Dollar system has abdicated in favor of the dollar(USD). Anybody who discovered the deposit in an unknown company will be claimed without source of support. The situation is, as the security company has been instructed to alert the authorities immediately. Due to the high level of confidentiality we have decided to seek for an independent foreign partner to carry out this transaction for the benefit of both parties. The security company has accepted our proposal to carry out this transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality, as they are completely sure of the existence of the deposit within the company itself.\nI want this transaction to be between two of us, with the security company's assurance that this deposit is a transaction of mutual benefit, and no one will have any negative effects on either of us. The security company has also sent copies of our bank balance to you with your direct and full particulars for verification, as well as your bank details to indicate whether or not this is a money transfer or cash transfer. The security company has also included a priority on how to

As the international remit officer in my department we are familiar with some of the most famous cases in Europe when foreign remites have been a problem to the victim of the Germanwings Flight 990/92/63/90 crash leaving no survivors behind. \nOn this note, I contacted you in March this year to assist in repatriating the money left behind by the passengers of Flight 990/92/63/90 on board the Germanwings  journey  to Moscow,  before they were deliberately dif  vanished on board the plane with most of the families aboard, as we are not allowed to operate any foreign account.\nI contacted you in South Africa only to be assured that our pending request for a permanent beneficiary will be secured and that you will be prepared to provide us with the nominated bank account so that the money can be transferred to your account for us to share in ratio of 75% for me and 25% for you and 80% for us for collecting taxes and miscellaneous expenses.\nMy department has therefore decided to seek for a foreign partner to carry on this transaction, as a matter of urgency, it is obvious that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us if carried out successfully because we would have enough funds to invest in your country at the peak of industrialization. \n

2. U.S.-Iraq War (2003-2006)\nThe War in Iraq erupted when Saddam Hussein resigned from office and ran on the Saudi name as the new president. He ordered all Iraqi war veterans to flee to Kuwait to seek political asylum. Most Shiites in Baghdad and Basra fled to exile in exile following the death of their husbands.\nToday, following the death of my husband, I and my two younger brothers fled to Kuwait to seek political asylum, some Iraqi war veterans left Kuwait for Iraq and many remained in Kuwait since the death of my husband.\nSome of the war veterans left Kuwait for Iraq fled as do some from other parts of Iraq who were formerly loyalists under Saddam Hussein and some members of the Nationalist Movement for independence fled because of the removal of the government of President Ali Akbar Saleh, who is a Shiite.\nBut I and my younger son were among the many who fell victim to the disastrous plan of removal by the government of President Akbar Saleh. The people were looting property and killing innocent people, they hereafter said that I must go down this road to join you. It is no secret that I am not allowed by the government of President Ali Akbar Saleh to fly out to Kuwait to seek political asylum.\nHowever, what disturbs me most is the fact that some members of the Nationalists who served under the present president have begun to act like the Nationalists.\nRecently, the Iraqi war veterans, my family and some of our close friends who used to be of my late husband's family members have been involved in some sort of organized attack. It is simple and obvious that I do not want this type of misfortune to come to me.

This is possible because my late father was a  private attorney. During the war, my father was one of the top generals in the  Republic of South Africa   and he was killed alongside with his family  in a plane crash. Before his death, my father had deposited the sum of US$12.5 Million (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a security company in Europe. I believe that this fund was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms in South Africa.\r\nIn my Father's last year in office, he told me that he made me the sole beneficiary of the fund. All that is needed is for me to make a numbered  \r\nWILL, and send by  receiving a trust fund  in your name to enable you prepare the necessary  documents and affidavites for the transfer of the fund to you.\r\nI am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business. Every thing regarding this transaction will be carefully worked out by you and after you have taken care of all the precautions  to ensure a safe transaction, then the money will be transferred to you for safe keeping.\r\nThe security company has plans to board and make  copies of the WILL and other relevant documents into  your personal  bank  account, then the money will be transferred to your personal account for safe keeping.\r\nIf you are interested in this business, you need not to have withheld the trunk from you  as you are not privy to all the details  I have been mandated to forward to you.\r\nI will be grateful to have your complete co-operation and cooperation in this transaction as the finance chief of security company in Europe, I will like to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free pending   the final deliverance of the trunk to you as soon as you accept to work.\r\nAs regards my father's finances,I have secured permission of the security company  to  move out the consignment left behind by my father into a security  company  to be  kept to  secure the consignment before
