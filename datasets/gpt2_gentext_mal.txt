BANGKOK (Thomson's Africa) - A 29-year-old Bangko Lamine tribal elder in South Africa who died on Thursday, February 6, 2012, by the members of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola).\nThe cause of death is still being verified by the staff of Regency hospital.\nThe war is on and there is still more to be done. Helping hands must be used to support one another to do good deeds. I am giving you the offers as mentioned with your consent. You are requested to receive a Cash deposit containing the bulk of the money (US$16,700,000) which is attached to a private security company in Bangko Lamine.\nThe principal business arrangement I and my company have with the South African Government is the Lawyer's License Agreement with Bangko Lamine Mining Corporation. It has an annual validity of 3 years and the money is attached to a security company building a company here in South Africa. During this period, every bullet fired lands with little or no warning.\nEvery bullet that lands on my company is scrutinized for bullet holes and bullet holes in the steel and the part of the bullet that is lodged in the chamber. This bullet has chambered by my South African Government. It has even chambered by my South African husband.\nDuring these periods of monitoring, bullet holes have been reported about 532 dead and over 500 injured, some dying from the bullet as a result of the internal struggle going on below.\nThe South African Government has failed us all many times before. In December 2006, an army tank traveling along with me and my party was killed in an ambush along with several civilians by Cossacks.\nThe present government in South Africa has nominated me as the next of kin to Lamine President Jairu Bashir as he has asked me to do sometimes for the government. In fact, I have also requested the assistance of one of his political party for safe keeping such as bank accounts and properties.\nThis request has been accepted and we are now going ahead to do some business. I will give you the full details, but first let me introduce myself to you.My Name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late

This letter might come to you as a surprise due to the nature of the trust that we have in you, as we have not met, we are not in any relationship, and neither are we related, just like no one else within our family has been, or will be,\r\nthis far since we were 12, and since then I have been waiting for your honesty and trust, and have waited for your reaction. I am very sorry for the embarrassment this letter might cause you, as I have believed all too well before in your capacity as a child to be averse to contact from a late father, since I am sure that this contact with you will be simple and direct, and that it will be\r\nfree of any embarrassment this might cause you. On further research, I believe that the amount of money in this transaction is very\r\nabundance over there, and the South African in particular, Mrs.Diratu musa, has a cash of over $25,000,000.00, and also a guitars box containing guitar\r\nepisodes.\r\n I have determined the most essential materials for the safekeeping of these boxes, and they contain\r\ninstructions for removal, along with the release codes of the boxes.\r\n I am therefore using this moment to send you the results of this nationwide\r\nfederal survey we are conducting of a nationwide nature.\r\n This is to ensure that this transaction is executed under acceptable\r\nstructural and legal practices. This requires a substantial amount of cash, such as a cheque or money order\r\nfrom a bank. I have a high-ranking South African Governmental Agency (GSA) official or a close friend or\r\nan associate of the President or the head of an institution to which the Fund belongs that wants the money transferred\r\nand packaged for transfer to the next of kin.\r\n For this, the beneficiary is expected to be someone from the government\r\nFederal Government that is in power now, or was in power since the current President\r\nashamed out to assume office. The cash sum is estimated to be US$25,000,000.00 (

Facts and Figures: The sum total of the money transferred or anticipated to be transferred between the parties in the course of this transaction is estimated at US$18.5Million dollars . This sum is estimated to be in addition to the sum already disbursed on behalf of my partner, which was already in transit by this time last year.\r\nBased on the above, I have decided to contact you through my privte email address (COGM@lawyer.com) for the disbursement of the larger percentage of the total sum to you for the betterment of both of us. Please note that this transaction is 100% risk-free and the major thing I was worried about was that the money would not be paid into your account.\r\nThe main reason I contacted you is to apply for a bank account. This offer is made pursuant to the Bank Holding Company (Amsterdam) Commercial Law (Civil) Organizations Code 2006(21) which stipulates that if you do not submit the necessary documentation to become a bank account holder, the bank will grant you a tax refund of 20% of the total sum. You must however note that this deal is not guaranteed, as some companies have\r\nfixed terms and loopholes that will be exploited by the companies that run the accounts. Also, be sure that this transaction is done with an absolute zero risk at all, as all the fuss is on after the election of an Austrian chancellor.\r\nI will adroitly and courageently arrange for a smooth transfer of ownership for you to us, over to your country for the purpose of tax administration, instruction and investment. This is done by my close friend, the late Andreas Schranner, our former banker and investment partner during the mass murder at the hands of Bitcoin and the related                                             Internal Revenue Service (IIS) has issued me a notice that my principal account number has been transfered from foreign bank to my name and address a\r\nfor my tax refund.

I have met with Nigerian officials and they have decided that this money is for my family and we intend to use it to invest within. The money is deposited in two Security Company projects here in Dakar and the company is expected to be fully functional by the end of this year. The security deposit is for 5 years and the government has been providing me with lucrative contracts to carry out contract completion and investment on our continent. This money (US$15,000,000) is for my family and I have no other choice but to accept this money.

It is with trust and confidence that I make this urgent and important business proposal to you on behalf of my colleagues and I.\r\nWe are members of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), a body which was delisted from the ITC in 2003 for alleged mismanagement of the fund.\r\nNNPC had reported in our favor the total amount of US$25.6 Billion. Unfortunately,after due deliberation with my colleagues, we decided to terminate the fund on the basis of mismanagement. This was necessitated by the fact that the fund was being invested by another party, the Zimbabwean Consortium of Estate Agents (ZAC).\r\nZAC has since removed the member from his position at the ZAC for failing to report the transfer to his local office.\r\nNigerian authorities have been conducting an internal review of the matter involving the fund and have found no substantial support for the claim. According to Nigeria Unbound, the director of PR relations, who was on hand to assist in the transaction, he was approached by a senior official of the ZAC who was attached to the Contracts & Finance for another project which he would like to proceed on.The PR person then instructed the repOS to immediately provide the full details concerning the investment and the results of the investment. The repOShip has now been extended for a further three years and the transaction has been authorized and is on course.\r\nThe PRN has mandated the repOSs holding the fund in the repOSs for a course of full compensation for their services, including promissory assistance. As per the PRN Policy, reposs shall bequeath to you the full amount of the sum to be transferred into your account for future use.\r\nWe hope to hear from you.\r\nYour able co-operation is highly needed as we demand transparent compensation for the fiscal results which we have declared for our treasury.\r\nWe regret that this problem of fiscal deficit in Nigeria is not being addressed urgently by the Government of Nigeria. As a necessity we urgently seek your immediate assistance to assist us in a speedy and disbursement of this fund. As soon as you assist, we expect your positive response through email to help us realise this fund's proposed arrangement

President Rodrigo Duterte vowed on Friday to pull the United States out of the war-torn country if the P5+1 countries do not stop supporting one another in the event of a political solution to the conflict.

Duterte said during a visit to Chad that the Philippines does not want the US to know how vital the friendship is for it to help arm and finance militias in the country under its control.

He also accused the other of instigating the violence through false claims and propaganda.

Duterte has lobbied the International Community to freeze US assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA peacekeeping troops in the country, and he wants the fund transferred under UNITA regional peacekeeping fund (CANC) with the help of his son, JEANKO.ANCIAL -\r\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday asked the International Community to help freeze US assets and accounts abroad, under the auspices of the Asian Community Economic and Social Development Fund (AESDF), as the next of kin to compensate the government for the suffering its citizens have been subjected to since the escalation of the war.The request of all three of us is made in light of the recommendations of the above-collected confidential HCM(Organization of the) on the Recovery of the Late 1980s and Early 2000s (JAPANESE REVIEWS). \r\nThe main reason why I requested for your assistance is the timely recovery of some of the dead which is why I requested for your assistance transfer of the funds to you. \r\nThe funds were transferred to you after the government of Nigeria issued an emergency decree on 31 December 2002. \r\nThe original value of the fund (US$26,000,000) have been discovered and are still being used by the government as human shields. The ministry of treasury has since released a number of critical documents that have shown that the funds were actually paid to me and my wife from my Dominican Reserve Drug Trafficking Area in Europe. \r\nSince then, government has issued numerous laws and guidelines to keep the funds confidential. \r\nThe most important of which is the identification of the beneficiary. \r\nThe E-MAIL AND THE MAIL ADDRESS OF THE FAMILY.\r\n

MUM WAS AWARE THAT SHE WAS A VICTIM FOR NEGOTIATION AND FOR NOT NEEDING A CONTRACT TO HAVING HER PASTE MAKED IN A CHEST.\r\nWHEN MY MOTHER DIED ON THE 21ST OCTOBER 1996, SHE WENT AWOL at the sight of this statistic and decided to PROVE her political beliefs through her Work In The Charity Industries.\r\nIn 1998, my late mother died and I have been left without a guardian for the past 3 2 MONTHS. I\r\nARE NOT BELIEVING SECRECY AND RELIABILITY OF THIS CONTRACT, SO LET ME SEE YOU ON WHAT YOU ARE WEARING.\r\nMy Uncle (MUM) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd October 1998. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my Uncle who is my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla!\r\nhere) to seek for political asylum.\r\nI am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe

When the Army returned to Zimbabwe in late July following a four-month overseas mandate, some 3,000 white farmers were killed in the conflict. The FAIR science based on official government documents has shown that between April and July of this year, more than 3,000 white farmers were killed. During this time, between April and July, more than 350 white farmers were wounded or killed; the government didn't stop at this, leading to the government moving to transfer the deceased's share of the money which was killed in the conflict, over to the other white farmers. According to the government, the remaining 80% of the money will be used to help pay for medical treatment of deceased relatives and travel expenses of some of the deceased's friends, families and co-workers. According to the government, the money will be paid for by white collar white men and they have no other choice but to give it to you for their assistance. They have also instructed us to get a white male to be our foreign partner to represent them in international banking transactions. Upon this, we would then sell or transfer the money to any bank in the world for lower premiums.\r\nplease treat this as confidential.\r\nWe have never met, but I want to trust you and please do not let us down when this fund finally gets into your account.\r\nPlease if you are interested get to me through my email address to enable me feed you with more details and all necessary documentations.\r\nPlease treat this as confidential.\r\nBest regards,\r\nJONAS SAVIMBI\r', 'RE: Assistance/Fund Transfer\nDear Sir/Madam,\r\nI got your contact from an email directory and decided to contact you for assistance.

Some people believe that my death was a last resort and that all related injuries were incurred before God's will. Consequently, all attempts are made to extradite me to the United States. Please kindly guide this page which will be used for all involved so that you understand the dire situation I am in. \r\nMy Uncle (Mentor) was killed while he was on a business trip to visit his followers in Africa. After his death, he and his family fled to South Africa where they are living with his only son, Johannes.\r\nNow, every day that he is gone, he and his family are asked to leave for a country where they are not needed. They stay with my mother and step-son, while my father and step-son go on holiday and recover from injuries sustained during the battle with the security forces.\r\nIn the course of the journey, I sustained a number of head injuries and died days later. I have been longing all this time for a Plan B opportunity, because I am convinced that the time is now to lay down and take a vacation. For now, I go on my merry way, as I am most grateful to God for having supported me so far.\r\nI would like to inform you in appreciation of the approximately $15.5million(Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) that is left over for the betterment of the country.

Bashir and his party have controlled the government since he led the military coup on 30 June 1989.\r\nThe Darfur conflict erupted in early 2003. Fighting among various factions has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced more than 2 million, most escaping to larger towns where they stay in camps for "internally displaced people," and some crossing the border into Chad, where they live in refugee camps, straining local resources. Attacks on civilians during the conflict have been brutal and include burning homes, killing and rape. There has been signed a Darfur Peace Agreement between some of the parties in Darfur. This agreement is supervised by African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS), though the war is still going on. Before the escalation of the war I was a VOLUNTIER SOCIAL WORKER and during my duties one of the local army Commander who was wounded in battle and dying from the wound handed over to me documents showing the sum of Twelve Million United States Dollars (US$12 Million) sent overseas mainly for purchasing foods, pharmaceutical drugs, Clothings etc for millions of Southern Sudan

For the past four years, I have been following the political situation in South Africa closely, and having positive experiences with President Jacob Zuma.

Consequently, I feel compelled to transfer this money and this equity to my son, to enable him make informed choices about how he intends to invest this money.\nI have a highly-regarded Financial Agent and he can help me envisage the course of this transaction.

Targeted investment (TIF) of $25 million. The total sum will be invested in trust for future growth and well being of the fund. No other person knows or can provide for this fund. It is a contract WPP executed with your company on behalf of the Red Cross of Nigeria. The contract was executed under white-listed companies with government contracts in Nigeria. It was executed by white-shore companies with policies of supervised investment. There is no other company with which to do this investment. It is a no-brainer for us because we have no other choice but to invest this money in trust.\n We have strong and reliable connections, top government and civil servants, as well as a number of highly paid government position. We have all approved and financed the contract and are ready to put in place a risk-free investment that will support us when the time is right.\n We want to leave no stone unturned to release this money from the clutches of security and political opponents, that is until the situation in Nigeria deteriorates further and further. As soon as this fund is mentioned this security and political problem will be treated with utmost secrecy. To that end, every thing regarding technical and logistics details will be kept strictly confidential, just as they have been since the contract was executed.\nTo that end, I have been specially interested in investing in your country for the past four years now, because I believe that having lived through this process before, investing in your country with your positive attitude is not surprising since I have witnessed this process from the very beginning. Also, having taken part in this business venture, I am prepared to offer your country three percentage points for your assistance, money which I want you to help us use for investment.\nTo this regard, my family has been investing a large part of the money in your country since before the financial crisis.\nIn fact, my father said, and I quote: �My country was invaded and invaded by Ethiopia in 1980. After four years, the troops gave in to African Union demands and invaded my family home. My family was able to safe stay in South-Africa but there was a problem. After the money was transferred to my father's trust, he abandoned the family for now, because he has faith that the assistance will be used for good

A/N: With love and light I wish this mail reach you in the most sincere of terms. I also wish to remind you of the great respect and esteem I have for you, and hope this mail will not betray this trusty mange.\nMy name is Mr. Colins Brown, the second in chief of staff to former president Gerald Ford. In a surprise move we have decided to contact you earnestly. This letter might seem strange but I want you to bear in mind that life is precious in this republic and I crave your indulgence to treat it with utmost trust and seriousness. I have only recently discovered your personality and my intentions were questionable, but I am convinced that you will not betray my trust and desire to work with you. Pending your prompt response send this email with your private telephone and fax numbers:>>>>>>>>\nFirst and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Mr.Robert Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Colson Brown, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. \nMy Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now desire a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to

President of the Republic of Zimbabwe Roberta Blah. He is also the mother of the late Blah, Blah's son Umayya Blah who died on the 8th of November 1998 while on a business trip with his Blah's. Umayya died along with his family on December 23rd, 2000 while on a business trip with Blah's. After his death Umayya's son Umar took office in as the new leader of South Africa African National Union (ANC). After Umar's death Umayya fled to South Africa where he is currently living. As I previously mentioned, Umar was a friend and adviser to Mugabe's who killed his mentor. After the death of my husband he became the next leader of South Africa without my knowledge or consent. After his death Umayya and Blah had an urgent need for a new leader and I were very moved to death when I first saw his profile. I was 11 years old then and Mr. Mugabe was only 14 at the time. I then made a new discovery and discovered that my husband had died without making a WILL, consent or applying for a foreign partner. This man was my mentor and was my mentor in death when I was only 12 years old. I am so happy that I discovered this vital news to this struggle for political life.

I have a confession to make. I have been a huge pro-Russian agent in Angola for two decades now.\r\nIn fact, I was one of the first to leave Angola and go to Russia as a refugee.\r\nAfter that, I was a political asylum seeker in Russia who got asylum in Thailand and landed in Phuket another city. After going through all the documents about this project, I concluded that this is actually a scam.\r\nI am sincerely asking you to help me prove to the world that this is real. That this is real, that this is not an act of desperation on my part, but rather of necessity. That this money (US$18.5million), which was originally deposited by my husband's brother's side in a security company in Thailand, is now being moved by government troops into a different security company in Phuket. This company was started by my late husband's second in law, Mr Zuhair Idris.\r\nThe money (US$18.5million) was originally deposited by my late husband's second in law's account in my name, and has been moving at least $18.5million(Two and a Half Million United States Dollars) since the initial start of this business. Most recently, on Friday the 13th, my husband's Secret Agent Mr. Bryant Douglas and I moved the money to a different security company in Thailand.\r\nWe have been trying to locate any of my husband's relatives or friends who might be with the Secret Service since the time of our last known location. This has prevented any of my husband's Secret Agents from getting to us. However, after many unsuccessful attempts, I decided to contact you and obtained copies of the USA and Thailand banking and finance codes for the families of the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\r\nPLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS WEB PAGE FOR IT SAYS ALL.\r\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_1839000/1839252.stm\r\nBefore the aboveUNITED STATES DOLLARS HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED IN A SECURITY COMPANY IN ABIDJAN

Us, a family of farmers in Southern Sudan who are saddled with the responsibility of managing the national money for the current crisis we are having, we inherited it in a gondola from my late father. Right before the death of my father, he wrote to say that because of the nature of the trust and confidence we have in each other, we will not give him money, stock or other consideration.\nSince then I have made several enquiries to his officials to locate any of his associate or business partners, but this has also proved unsuccessful. I then contacted your office to confirm the presence of his associate or business partner, but this has also proved to be untrue. I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left behind by my late father before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where these huge deposits were lodged.\nThis is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Minister will prepare the necessary measures to bring about this transaction.

After 24-hours, I am very sorry for the delay in this mail but I need your kind assistance in bringing this subject to you by email. My purpose in bringing this business to you is to seek for a refund of some of the money transferred from my bank. This money (Eighteen Million United States Dollars) was transferred from the Secret Vault of one of my banker's account to your account on the 11th of December by my courier. The courier didn't know that this money is still in place by my late husband, his wife and their three children before he took the money and transferred it to your account. I have since paid his share of the money and it has been legally transferred into your account.\r\nI am giving you the offers as mentioned before for your assistance, but first I want to discuss a very important consideration: nature of the money.\r\nMy husband is a lawyer by profession. I was raised in a Christian family and I have no other family member who can stand as a public servant and this money (Eighteen Million United States Dollars) belongs to my late husband. He has all the legal documents for the deposit and has permission to do business with you. He and his family are about to present me as the new aggressor in the money (Eighteen Million United States Dollars). I want to transfer this money and present it to you as the real deal. I am the daughter of Late J. Bryan Moses M. M. and I have decided to propose a new relationship by developing a close and confidential confidential relationship with you. This fund (Eighteen Million United States Dollars) should you agree to be our partner, we will share fruits, family goods, mutual funds, clothing, home furnishings, computers, pharmaceutical drugs, pharmaceutical products, pharmaceutical drugs and seeds.\r\nI want to enrich and open a bank account for you. This is very important because this money (Eighteen Million United States Dollars) belongs to a highly trusted foreign national who died while my husband was away.\r\nI want to draw attention to the fact that there is no corruption going on here. Although some quarters might object because of the life-threatening emergency that is his condition, I want to assure you that the situation is under control. We only lost one of our livestock (M

A Quickie Appreciation Day present to you, my son JONI EGYA, Uncle JONI EGYA, Engr. to the Rebel Forces of Angola. I am sincerely humbly asking that you take due consideration of his importance and immense resource, and that he take all necessary measures to safeguard this document.\r\nFirst and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is JONI EGYA, the eldest son of the late Brigadier-General Idriss K. Colby, the front line leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). Brigadier-General Colby, was killed in a surprise attack by government troops of Angola on Friday 22nd February 2002. Colby was leading a major offensive to liberate the city of Diliza from government troops. Colby had negotiated a contract with the UNITA military committee and was leading the battle on to liberate the country.\r\nOn the 21st February 2002, Brigadier-General Colby was killed in a battle with government troops of Angola. After his death, the leadership of UNITA changed its tune and announced that Colby had died along with 35 other senior UNITA officers and mainly staffs. The army and police forces of UNITA have been trying to clear the country of all political parties, militias and organizations since the death of my father. It has been almost four years since my last known movement or address here. During this period, I have been involved in a series of miscellaneous but significant activities.

So far, more than 5,400 white owned farms have been invaded, properties confiscated and farm lands seized. During these periods, as reported by the international media and C.N.N, more than 500 white farmers were killed; the government didn't stop at this, as just recently the government has asked all white-farmers to give up their farms to black farmers or risk going to prison. Having lived in this country (Zimbabwe) for more than 35 years, I have no other country to go to, nor can I trace any of my distant relatives.\r\nTherefore, I decided to contact you through my local Zimbabwean associate (Mr. Dennis Udongo) for your assistance so that I can establish a company in your country and relocate there. Also, I must re-iterate the importance of having a citizen of your country to front as the owner of the enterprise, due to the fact that I will be a foreigner in your country. For this purpose, I have deposited in a Security Company based in Amsterdam (Holland) all the funds realized from the sales of my farmland and other farming equipment which amounted to USD18, 500,000.00 (Eighteen million, five hundred United States Dollars). These funds was packaged in two metal boxes and declared as personal effects and photographic materials so as to avoid detection by immigration/security officials

One of the main reasons I came to Holland and sought for political asylum was the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then moved the Uncle's body to a secure location, which the Uncle had held for some time now, but has now been moved. The Uncle died there, on the 8th of February,2014. I am now contacting you to seek for your assistance in the case of your country's fiscal records and financial position before this fund is transferred to your account. \nMy Uncle was a highly regarded trader with the South African rand when the tragic incident of his death occurred. This sum of US$18.5million (12,000,000,000.00) was moved from your country's treasury on the instruction of my late husband. \nWith the help of a few trusted friends, I managed to secure the release of this money launderable via the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad. \nI am very grateful to you for your kind understanding and co-operation. For this money is presently in a suspense account in Botswana under the name of Intrusion and Cover-Up and it contains some of the world's most valuable diamonds. Bearing in mind that your kind is being generous I am asking you to provide us with 30% of the total money for the trust invested in your kind. This money should be paid to you by the time you board my plane flight to South Africa. As a result of your kind's assistance, we have agreed that 30% shall be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and external) accrued between the parties in the course of the transaction. It should be noted however, that whatever share you have reserve in respect of diamonds left behind by my husband that we want you to clear for us. \nFor your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. \nI have a high regard for you and look forward to urgently hearing from you. \nYours truly, \nYour Private Scholastic Adviser..,
