This is one of the problems that I want to get back to you on and how we can help or contract which was my problem from the start.\nThe first thing I want you to do for us is to equip you with a very good contract that will be of great help to you in the long run.  The original contract for this vehicle was US$35,000,000.00,(Thirty Million, Hundred Thousand USA Dollars) which we falsely claims as being on file with the CBN here in South Africa.  The original contract was not breached because the fund was transferred without the knowledge or knowledge of my self or my partners.\nOur company is based here in South Africa where the officials have been demanding that sums exceeding US$35,000,000.00(FIFTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) be paid to a beneficiary, who they claim as his father, SKANK PUSSIANSKI, a citizen of Russia and HIGHLY RESIDENTIAL, a national of Cape Town in South Africa.  Prior to his death on 30 JULY 2000, he was a very rich and reputable man who operated in this country as an asylum seeker.  On the 21st of JULY 2000, we made a numbered time(Fixed)deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$35,000,000.00 (Thirty Million, Hundred Thousand USA Dollars) in my branch. It does not matter whether or not you are a Foreigner or a Citizen, as long as the document of deposit is intact and signed by a true and honest person.  No breach of trust will ever befall our company if we are to continue with this business, because we have made this deposit with a genuine authorised bank of South Africa account, notarization of the balance of $35,000,000.00 (Thirty Million, Hundred Thousand USA Dollars) in a security company in their branch.\n  We have perfected the art of  fact-based\nand\nconfidential  correspondence of this nature, on the subject of\npayment.

Following on the death of my brother i decided to relocate the money abroad and for your support and partnership, my mother has already passed on and will soon be leaving for New York.\n  As the eldest child of my late parents life, I am saddled with the responsibility to go through this money, and it will only make me sadder. My late father Mr. james johnson operated bank in Europe. He died in a plane crash on 31 January,1999.See my mail for more details. On the 21st of January, 1999, my late father Mr. james johnson mowed down four people in a crudely laid-out house in a suburb of iraq, Kenya, United Arab Emirates, in a bid to profiteering from the disaster.\n  My late father has since moved out with me and my younger sister and so my elder sister and my elder sister are also aware of this news, and are begging me to come over to their country for them to carry out the expenses incurred during the entire plan to the last detail, hence my contacting you.I have been making efforts to contact you, but all is not well.\n  Since my late father's passing, all attempts to trace his next of kin has been fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that my late father did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$6,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my Uncle\'s bank as his deposit for the next of kin.\n  No one has ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.\n  Consequently, my late father has decided to use his position as a head of state to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries and foreign exchange\n

I got your contact through my research in business journal. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.On June 6, 1998, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Russian Federation Mr.Rem Kramo Boris Oil Corporation, he made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$27,000,000.00 {Twenty-Seven Million Dollars)in my branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.\nAfter a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Russian Federation Oil Company that Mr.Rem Kramo Boris died from an automobile accident.On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin or relations was fruitless.\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Rem Kramo Boris did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$27,000,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safe keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it.\nAccording to the South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Rem Kramo Boris so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.\nAny bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.\nThe money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 40% for me and 40% for you, while 10% will be shared for any expenses that come our way

I don’t know what to do.

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Richard Moss died from an automobile accident.\r\nOn further investigation, I found out that he died without making a [WILL] for his services, and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.\r\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard Moss\r\ndid not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.\r\nThis sum of US$21,000,000.00 has carefully been fixed in his account and the interest is being rolled over at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.\r\nMy reason for sending the mail is to seek a\r\nforfeited deposit from him; I cannot stand to have this money\r\nin my bank. Stopping short of freezing all his  Bank accounts, I will  however,  seek\r\nyour permission to present you as the next of kin of Mr. Richard Moss so that the\r\nfruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some\r\ncorrupt Government

We have set out in our annual report that We have set out in our annual report that we expect an annual budget surplus of US$21.3Mlin by the end of this year, and the Government of South Africa is working to obtain the money before interest on My family's mutual funds will be the last secured means of payment.\r\nThe original plan was to transfer the fund into the Federal Government Bank for Foreign Exchange (F.G.E) in South Africa but the plan was to transfer the fund into a Foreign Reserve Bank by the end of the year.\r\nIt was discovered by our Monitoring Services from the World Bank that the fund has been transferred into the Federal Ministry of Finance (MinFinance) without valid Foreign Contract /Export permit. The request of a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We make this effort out of the desperation of an age. We stand behind you, believing that you will never let us down either now or in future.\r\nWe have been out of the country for more than a month now with the help of my family lawyer friend who is also my husband's personal lawyer. I am presently in a hospital where the Chief Medical Officer is Drayton Mandela, and the disease is still mired in its past.\r\nWe are currently undergoing medical treatment here in Pretoria. I am the personal lawyer to the late Drayton Mandela, and I have reposed my trust in you.\r\nBecause of the way our client is going, I want to present you as his next of kin. If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address below. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% risk free.\r\nYou should observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.\r\nAwaiting your urgent reply via my private email address: mrs_mabo@latinmail.

This is a reply to your letter of Late Mr.Kenneth Welsh, My Letter of Mr.Kenneth, On behalf of the Trustees and Executor of the estate of Late Mr.Kenneth Welsh, I once again appeal to your good\r\ncompassion, My name is an immigrant from Jamaica, and I was a child of late Mr. Edwin Welsh, a Ghanaian. I came to the UK from Jamaica, and left the Country. After a considerable amount of money, I was falsely accused by my friends World War II veterans, and i was subsequently accused by some influential Government officials of making unclaimed endowments and payments to former War Veterans. It was my late friend who broke the law by depositing the Sum of Euro. The law here stipulates that if such money is remained unclaimed for more than ten years, the money will be forfeited to the Government treasury. The said officials had submitted that since my late friend's death, nobody has come forward to claim this money. \r\n Before his death, I and some members of my family who are members of the Ministry of Finance and I and some other officials in the said Ministry had an account receivable from the period 1985 to 1998,000 US Dollars (US$13,000,000.00) which has been dormant since 1998,000 US Dollars. The said official has been ill-disposed of and since then my family has been in a state of disarray, since I left the Government. I have been managing the accounts of the late late Mr. Edwin Welsh with the said Ministry of Finance and I have been very unsuccessful in transfering the funds to me. I am now seeking your consent to present you as the next of kin to my late friend so that the funds will be transfered into your account.\r\n This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, to put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the

As you may know, my\r\nbusiness men are very much in search of reliable and reputable partner\r\nwho will assist them in a transaction or other transaction of\r\nvalue which will benefit both parties.\r\nMy late husband and his family have been in business in South\r\nAfrica for some time now and their wealth still remains in the\r\nSouth African Government as unclaimed bill. Hence the reason for\r\nseeking a reliable partner to assist in the transaction of such\r\nfunds so that the family can claim it as their own.\r\nTo be explicit and straight to the point. As the eldest of\r\nhis family, I am saddled with the responsibility of inheriting the\r\nproperty left behind by my late husband from an earlier\r\nstage before the present present. I took the position that the\r\nproperty belonged to my late husband because he did not produce\r\nany kind of business on behalf of my family. Now that I have passed through\r\nfamine/apostasy, disease and death throes, I cannot live with my\r\nlife. Hence my decision to take this stand and present my\r\nnext of kin as the next of kin to my late husband. This is simple, I\r\nwill like you to provide immediately your full names\r\nand address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary\r\ndocuments and affidavits which will put you in place\r\nas the

After 14 years of prohibition, we found a box in his trunk that he meant handed to him for 'share'.\nThe owner of the box  is Mr. Engr. Phillip Morris. He was a well-known investment banker, and a resident of Dubai, United Arab Emirates. On the 21st of April 2001, my friend and I as we were travelling through our personal file in an office in the Ministry of Finance in Abu Dhabi, we discovered an abandoned sum of  US$6.5m Dollars.  In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family through plane crash disaster disaster while on business trip to Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\nSince we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless his next of kin or relative applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guide lines and laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. This is the reason why we have decided to release the money to your\nknowledge free of charge for your participation or next of kin to the deceased since nobody will ever come for it and we don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed bill.\nThe Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after six years, the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreign as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\nThe request of a foreign as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

I want to count to ten, because this is my only hope. I want to keep this information private and to show my appreciation and respect to you for your assistance in this venture.\r\nI am a member of the Nigerian Working Group on National Petroleum Goals, which was established by the President joseph P.N. Selaka to facilitate a more uniformity and cost-effective management of national petroleum resources. I also serve on the Committee on Strategic Services that worked on the last Nigerian President, Late President Robert Mugabe. During his life time he ordered the seizure of all all official petroleum resources by the ruling party and also looted government treasury. He put on the country's new currency, the bauxite State Dollar. Late President joseph P.N. Selaka though, did not support President joseph P.N. Selaka to be re-elected president because he said that if he does not support me then the country will get under way.\r\nMy reasons for opposing you is that I believe that if I are to be trusted, then you are me. My country is still in crisis and it has become very difficult for me to leave my country. I have been nominated by my colleagues in the Committee to stand as the next of kin. This is to assure that the fruits of my country's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is a problem I am sure will never get resolved. I do not wish to make any mistake here and I will fight vigorously to get this matter over with as soon as possible.

From Halopedia, Direct Link : http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3388705.stm\nDear Friend,\nI am Edward Burkhard,the Director of Procurement and Contract awarded workforce Development of the African continent. On behalf of the Board of Contract Awarding Commissions (CAPA) in charge of awarding contracts to foreign contractors, I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you.\nOn June 6, 2000, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Government of South Africa, Mr.G. Beck made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$28,500,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) that Mr. Beck died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Beck did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.\nThis sum of US$28,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.\nAccording to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Beck so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. I am writing you because I as a public servant,i cannot operate a foreign account.\nI want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim them with

A Swedish Airlines flight 990 that crashed on 31 January, 1996,with 239 people on board,including the passengers and crew. The CEO of AFSCME SA, JOHN NELSON,and the Director of AFSCME and one of his sons were among the deceased.  Late CEO John Nelson died on the 13th day of February 1996 of cancer.  His son John Nelson and son John David Nelson Jr were the only surviving sons. The deceased are: JOHN NELSON, JOSEPH NELSON, ALAN AND Richard Nelson .  The claims of the funds in question are (USD$25,000,000.00) One hundred and twenty million United States Dollars.  and twenty six million United States Dollars.  I have contacted AFSCME SA to confirm the total funds in question and confirm the fund transfer procedures of AFSCME SA. The procedure is that in my department I discovered an abandoned fund valued at U.S $25,000,000.00 (Twenty six Million United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family on a business trip abroad in Europe in 1996.  Meanwhile, the manager of our foreign customers account who informed me about the death has been dismissed and is now contacting his next of kin to claim the funds. Now I am in need of the funds as next of kin or relation to the deceased for the purpose of transfer out of the United States Bank account. The request of next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the deceased customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.  We agree that 45% of this money will be for you as a foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 5% will be set aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me.  For your security and government assistance, I am writing you so that you can assist me out of this business.  Please provided you are interested, also cooperate with me in transferring this fund up to your country.   There after, I will come over and talk to you over this.

Further Education and Further Experience, which I have commended you for your boldness in standing up for and opposing the barbaric ideology of the regime in Muammarism, are guiding me and making up my mind before I make any next step. I must not give up, as the situation in Sierra Leone is changing and the need for a new personality is very great.I have a younger sister, who is still in Muammarism, and I am in urgent need of a trustworthy and Honest person to guide me and assist me in this deal. As for the fund, my late father died in the war, and my mother died in the Holocaust,and my father was a prosperous Tobacco merchant before her death.

It's no secret that Audiophiles operate in the motorway industry, hence the impressive number of liars, cheats and liars in the world. Some of the liars include:

1. ALI HASSAN  IBN , a British Oil tycoon.;

, a British Oil tycoon.; 2. CHARLES TAYLOR , a Liberian; 3. JERRY BENSON , a US citizen; AND 4. KENNETH GOLDER , a German.    More and more, Audiophiles operate in the motorway industry because they are paid in cash or nothing at all to operate/support such vehicles. As a result, they are at the top of the list of the most wanted/leaked Audiophiles in the world. According to the IFR, one out of every five drivers of a foreign-registered car will have a foreign display number plates for the sake of embarrassment or embarrassment. Though this is true in some cases, as the IFR proves, the practice is not against the law. The IFR further states that when a foreign registered vehicle is lost in storage, the money paid into the account by the owner will be credited into the account. The owner of the foreign registered car, without his consent, the money which resulted from the accident, died along with his family members. The fund has now been paid into the account by the owner of the car, which has been deliberately diverted to the wrong beneficiary. More so, the company where the money was deposited has refused to give the money to the family members who own the car, and this has resulted in the death of the family members and the financial ruin of the company.  THE IFR further states that the amount of the fund is Eighteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only\n(US$18,500,000.00) Sixteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only.  It is my duty to report this money to my bank as a secret  transaction. It is in\nsecurity in my honour and I do not want this money to go into the wrong\nhanders account.

More so we discovered from his bank records that in the year 1999 Mr. Morris died alongside with his entire family as a result of an automobile crash. This sum of US$27,500,000.00 is still sitting in a security company and the funds is being watched and monitored with loop to the year 2000 as the fund is dormant.\nWe demanded immediate release from the authorities so that such money will be moved out of the country and we want you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Morris and claim this fund as his heir as we cannot release the fund unless there is some further action being taken by the government to Weigh the claims and then transfer the money into a safe accountforeigners or international property.\nOur concern is that this money may be dormant for some period of years as the government officials officials have refused to hand over the fund to us, because they are apprehensive of any scandal from the government.\nThis is the reason why we have agreed that the funds will be paid to you on the spot and the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the beginning of the year, so it will be no problem to move this fund out of the country for safety.\nWe will be transferring this fund into a foreign account where you can receive the fund in your country.\nAll the knowledge base relating to this transaction, will be on you as the parties and the manager of this company, so contact me immediately for more details as time is not on our side.\nAll I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I am also willing to give you 20% of the total sum as compensation to your efforts,while the remaining 60% will be for me. I will need

This trip took us from city to university town, we made a total of 50 bus trips, the whole trip cost $15,000.000(TWENTY -FIVE MILLION SIX HUN�THOUSAND US DOLLARS) which we deposited in a bank in GARAVIA.

I don't want him to have any of this money in this account if he is not near my client, either by name or relation. This is the reason why I have submitted to the authority of my court conciliation documents, which states that the whole account will be paid to my client if I do not provide a next of kin, or relation to my client immediately.

The government of Nigeria has banned all foreign investment in Nigeria and all Nigerian companies. The Nigerian government has also suspended all payments to foreign and local contractors for financial reasons. Nigeria has been in a state of crisis. The current crisis in Nigeria started with the ouster of President General Sani Abacha by the military junta led by his son Gen. Yiannis Abacha and has been winding down in the country and political crisis in the country has intensified. As a result of the current situation in Nigeria, the Nigerian government has decided to lift all the export ban on the goods of exporters to Nigeria and other European Countries and also lift all import ban on items like refineries and processed foods to avoid the exporters going bankrupt.\r\nThe move is being carried out by the ruling Sano Abacha party and this year African Development Bank (ADB) chief Mohammed Mouna gave the order to lift the exporters ban. The decision was taken at the height of the military uprising against the military dictator General Sani Abacha and he ordered all Federal Government departments to prepare themselves for a future military conflict. In the past, United States couldn't directly buy weapons, hence the decision by the government. My colleagues and I, we are preparing ourselves for a possible military conflict as the Military Finance Finance Committee (MFF) of Finance and Security Corporation (F.SC) headed by General Sani Abacha (former military chief General Sani Abacha Executed in a mob uprising) has approved the total sum of about US$16.7 million for the purpose of financing military operations. All government defense Ministry and other civilian functions are to be delegated to F.SC. As the chairman, I can resign from office if I do not remit these funds within 14 days. The request of a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkina cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. Awaiting your urgent reply.\r\nThanks and God bless.\r\nN.B, we shall be transferring the total fund into your account for us to carry out our mutual purpose of investing in lucrative fields such as Mining,

The managing director of SEBIBANK  Japan Ltd, deceased, Mr.Makuyo Yamaguchi, a foreigner and a sailor, a great man, deeply affected by the current situation here in Japan, and the refusal of the Japanese Government to release all his payments, including his wife\'s deposits in a foreign bank account, as well as all his Bank Dealing and dealing with the Bank under my watch, all this because the Japanese Government has de-emphasized the plight of the refugees in the world.\r\nIt is pertinent here, that the transfer of the funds in question, which took about six months, took place before I got information concerning it to you.I got your contact through the world trade center (W.T.C) trade center of Davos, Switzerland, a club of wealthy foreign business men, who is disputing over the transfer of the money from the W.T.C to a refugee organization. They refused to give up peacefully, and so in the course of June, 1999, I and my colleagues made several unsuccessful attempts to contact the occupants of the W.T.C, but all proved to be false. All attempts by the occupants to reach you was fruitless as we all knew that he is from Africa, and as such we cannot trust his claims to the W.T.C. as the owner of a motorized  vehicle.\r\nThis is the true nature of the situation, and it demands that you understand with utmost seriousness.

We kept the word of the true religion of the land for our lives, the words of the prohibition against using of any thing inveterate or base on the words of the law, until we were in a state of need and believed, and finally we discovered that our lives were at risk if we did not learn the truth.We prayed, we prayed, and we prayed. The Lord blessed us with the (Prayer) and we will provide you with the answers to this great and very important question.In truth,I prayed before my death that I might easily die hence I prayed that if you are willing to listen to the truth,then the truth be my prayer.I believe that your Allah will be in your side as you assist in the transfer of the (Prayer) and the fund of the (Prayer) will be your share.I believe that you will be capable to provide me with some of the things that I need from you.I believe that you will listen to my prayer and you will not let me down either way.I believe that you will not let me down either now or in future.I believe that you will not let me down either now or later as I have prayed this whole thing in an ungodly manner.I believe that you will not let me down either now or in future.I will pity you and never let you down either now or in future You are the only person that I have contacted in this transaction.I am just a child and being a child I don't know how to search for an answer.I prayed all my life for the information to be safe and the Allah willing will make up the balance of the total sum of $18.2 million before my death.And my mother,mother and child,while bearing witness that I am the one that protected the truth and the truth in the whole of this transaction.I am in an orphanage here in Kenya.I have no one I pray to be safe and i will be there

Since the death of my father on 25 Mar 2003, no one has come forward to lay claim to this funds, as it was to the former treasury of the Muslim Republic of Nigeria. My late father, MR. AHMED ABU JANZAH (BAJAN). Since his death, he has been sitting as the personal treasurer of the National Credit Corporation (NCN) National Bank of Nigeria, N. Africa. My late father deposited the total sum of US$31.5M, with a private security company in Lagos, Spain after he was poisoned by his political rival, MR.SON DAVID KABBA, who was earlier accused of plotting to take over the Nigerian state. My late father also deposited the sum of US$20.5M, with Security Company in Southern Africa. For his life savings MR. AHMED ABU JANZAH, my late father actually invested the money in real estate business in Lagos Spain which he foresaw would be the next-of-kin to the fraud. In fact, the newspaper which cover this country daily, the daily Al Hurair time, hit the spot, in a picture published by my late father, went on suicide. \nNow my late father does not own any shares in any business, or have any interest in owning any.

Since the death of my father, we have been living a life of insecurity and hopelessness, hopelessness and these days. I have no thing to assist him in facing the fact that he has died peacefully, he has been peacefully living. I have seen no sign of him at the moment as my father has been acting strange and he even refused to give me his telephone number. I have no thing more to assist him in claiming his money and property from the security company as he is in a state of shock and hopelessness. I have contacted you and told you that we are going to travel to Europe for the future of my father and arrange all necessary things so that he will be safe. I will destroy all his properties leaving no trace to any place and to send a consignment of money to your country as a backup fund arranged for by you. I have also set up a loop to siphon off some funds. Late father has supplied the list of approved foreign bank account and will open a new account in europe by the end of next year. My name is Faisal Ahmed. I am the last son of my father, Ahmed mohameed, who was murdered in Somalia. I escaped with my life. My name is Faisal Ahmed. I am the only son of my father, whose last name was Saeed mohameed. I am from Somalia. I was in a civil war here in this country. My father was a rich tin and tin miller from this country, before he was killed and mutilated by the security company here in europe. He was a founding member of the Committee to Protect the Congo Free Trade Association (C.T.F.C.) .I am the first son of my father and a university undergraduate. My father died on the 3rd of October 1999 into the control of the security company here in europe. His body was retrieved from the morgue and sent to the morgue for burial. I am the last son of my father, I have no other choice than to seek for the aid of a foreign or African partner, where my life is in danger.

I got your contact through our International Business relationship.\r\nBefore the war, I had a client, a Russian firm, who made bombs and other destructive\r\nInfact. In the year 2000, a Russian Emirate Foreigner, Mr.Vladimir Putin\r\nin charge of the oil industry Company in Russia.\r\nHe died in a car accident and the Russian Government has been\r\nLate Adviced to Banish him. The real reason why Mr. Putin has been\r\nBanished has been the omission of all the key Russian Officials.\r\nThis is the reason why it is very necessary that Mr. Putin resigns\r\nbefore he can proceed with the claim of the fund as the next of kin to the\r\nbeneficiary of the Russian official.\r\nThis request of you came as a surprise and I have been expecting your\r\nsurprise in the mail as a result of your unsolicited proposal to\r\nmeet me at J.D. Power Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina.\r\nI am a lawyer and this is the reason why I informed the Secretary\r\nwho in turn will take the steps to ensure an end to this\r\ndeal.\r\nI will be compensating you with 25% of the total sum as compensation,\r\nthough this is negotiable for both parties as the\r\nbeneficiary of the funds.\r\nI will be compensating you 30% for your advice while the remaining\r\n5% will be\r\nleaving the United States for onward investment in your\r\ncountry.\r\nAll I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this\r\nwin this transaction through. I AM CONTACTING YOU TO HEAR\r\nAS THOSE EFFECTIVE EXECUTIONS AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE THIS\r\nMILLION NINETEEN POUNDS.\r\nI AM REQUESTING YOUR ASSISTANT PART
====================
This project was started by my late father to establish a good reputation in the Commercial community. I believe in Almighty God that you will never let me down either now or in future.\r\nI shall be expelling you immediately you receive this money, with all the attendant documents to back it up as the REAL MASTERFACTORY CONTRACT signed by my late father in the end of 2001.\r\nThe original documentation of this transaction was a copycat of the Foreign Contract document which was in my name. It was signed in 2001 by my late father. This document was meant to be a binding document between us as we are the rightful owners of this valuable business.\r\nUnfortunately, the documents officials at the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) have confiscated the contents and are clamping down on any foreign co-operation with the site of the transaction.\r\nThis is because they regard the content of this contract as a second contract between us and they have mandated that if such a contract remains unravelled they will discard it from the records and destroy all documents of transaction immediately we and my father gets any contact from any of our dealings with any of our family members. This is because we have not received any reply to any letter sent by any of our family members that we have not met or known our selves before.\r\nIt is a fact that our fathers earliest business interest was in the construction of the Sarl, which is a prime access road to the Turkish coast. We are very wealthy and well connected business men and this interest drove us to seek out foreign assistance in the areas we are handling this project in.\r\nThis is however fruitless on account of our differences from our fathers country. We are however able to wring out a reasonable amount of money from this project for our country, which we intend to invest in real estate investment.\r\nTo put it simply, we have been making claims to properties in the area for sale and the management of the properties has unanimously agreed to provide the money to us for our personal use.\r\nThis is the real reason why we decided to contact you and demand your account details so
====================
But since I have been unsuccesfull in my job in this country as a banker and other top officials, I have been thinking of other career paths and decided to locate a reliable foreign partner that will assist me as I move forward with this business proposal.\r\nMy recommendation to you is simple. I got your information from a reliable source, whose contact I know well. This person has bank accounts in numerous countries all over the world, and they all confirmed my destination through authentic international passport.\r\nI have assured them that the funds will be intact pending my physical arrival in your country for the sharing of the fund. The source of this fund is an account opened in the bank in 1999 and since 2000 nobody has operated on this account again, after going through some old files in the records I discovered that my late father's company died without a beneficiary for at least four years and the fund has been frozen deposited with any account that my late father used to operate before his death.\r\nI am simply, Mr Nelson Pimentaleki, and I am from Nigeria. I am contacting you as a foreigner because I don't have a more perfect and transparent name.  I want to present you as the owner of this account which I am going to present for the release of the fund. I am contacting you because I don't want my image and I as a public servant to look for another foreign partner in Africa who will assist me and explain my proposal to you. I want to present you as the owner and operator of at least $31.5m ( Sixteen Million Five hundred Thousand United States Dollars) within a foreign bank account that he used to operate a bank in Nigeria.\r\nThe account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this money is not his and my father's, that he never married or had a children with before he died, the account has no other beneficiary and my father did not even know that this money is money outside Nigeria. I am simply, Mr Nelson Pimentaleki and I am from Nigeria. I am contacting you because I don't have any other child and I don't want my image and I as a public servant to

This is from our web-site. Please observe the guideic documents as we will wish to know your personal talk about this project from the very beginning.\nI got your information on abusiness. I contacted you hoping that you could be a possible business partner for us to share this project,I have been receiving intel from the Centre that you might be one of the next of kin of the unfortunate. I did not disclose this information to any one that contacted me, hence my role in this transaction is only a pretext to this transaction. I had hoped toluccess this information to our benefit and would have done it but, it is Commission that dictates that all contract payments be made to companies that our committee members cannot quite agree.This is the reason why we need your assistance to offset the increased duties and cost of this transaction.The request of a foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.\nThis transaction is not even close to over, we are still in service and have agreed to offer you 25% of the total sum as compensation for your efforts in helping us to move this money out of nigeria into your favour for us.\nWe will send to you a copy of the notice of the transaction so that you can forward it to us and we will read it for us. We will use our position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for this transaction and get this money into your country for onward transfer to your account for us.\nWe will use all our positions and influence to obtain all necessary documents backing this transaction and get this money into your country for us.We have also seized all the documents that will guarantee this funds will be approved to any foreigner as next of kin of a kin, we will use all our positions and influence to effect this transaction.\nYou are mandatory and immediate in receiving the receipt of this mail box, follow me on my private email address for further details.

After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Rick Santopolo died from an automobile accident.On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.\r\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Rick Santopolo did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$26,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping.No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.\r\nConsequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Rick Santopolo so that the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin.\r\nWe shall
