[THE] MASSAQUOE FAMILY\nInheritance Trust Fund.\nI am  Mr KRISTO CHABOTTI, from Zimbabwe. I am the son of late DR.ANDREW CHABOTTI, who was the president of Zimbabwe for over 20 years before he was impeached for his alleged role in the death of the president, Robert on 8th April 2000. This was a very sudden change in the political situation in Zimbabwe and as a result of this introduction of the new Land Act Reform 1993(L.890) which wholly affects the rich white farmers of Zimbabwe, my father's land ownership and his wealth have been massively confiscated and confiscated by the entire black Zimbabwean Government. This government has promised to compensate the Zimbabwean farmers as promised sum of US$20,000,000.00(Twenty Million Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with State-issued  identification cards that all Zimbabwean Government services and institutions were totally and completely decimated, all black Zimbabwean Government offices and properties have been completely destroyed and the government has also issued me a decree to confiscate all his personal and company properties including the bank accounts of at least 20 branch of ZIMBABAN bank where I work as a civil servant.\nMy father deposited the sum of USD$15,000 000.00 (Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) with a security and finance company in Europe.\nRecently, an international diplomatic corps and the Zimbabwean embassy in Africa came to our condemnation due to the abysmal survival of our people. This Bank has since been resolved to return the deposit to their shores as indicated in their terms and conditions.\nMy father has duly applied for the release of this deposit to a foreign company for the processing and investment of the investment in his country. I am presently in Johannesburg, South Africa as a refugee and as such, I have no knowledge of how this money will be transferred or spent by the security firm. I need your assistance in processing and investing the deposit. I have all the necessary legal documents as to

The battle has been going on for over twenty years now. In 1993, Laurent Kabila became the first son of Laurent Kabila the former head of state of Liberia.I and my men were assigned by the security company of the federal government of Nigeria to locate, arrest and freeze any person(s)involved in the (Liberian) dia crisis either before his death or subsequent conviction for war crimes. As the eldest son of his family, I was saddled with the problem of finding a genuine daughter to inherit the money which my late father left behind for us. Before his death, he had deposited the sum of US$15,500,000.00(Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in a security firm here in NIGERIA. The deposit documents are with the security company. I and my younger brother have decided to use this money to relocate to any of Africa where we can live independently. The amount in question is Abdul (Dav) Kabila. I am not aware of any other person whom I can trust and whose name is not known to me. I want you to assist us so that this money will be released to you and you will receive 20% of the total money for your efforts and 50% for us. We want you to provide us with more details about the deceased and the properties where he deposited the money. Thereafter, we will take over his banking and legal documents (including the Social Security numbers). We will then need to transfer this money to any foreign land I loose in Nigeria.\r\nThis will be a secured deposit of the type that is presently being prepared by an overseas firm. This will involve you taking 2% of the money and investing it (10% for me and my brother). This transaction is risk free as all required arrangement has already been made. I have concluded terms with the security firm which is why this transaction is being kept secret and confidential.\r\nAnd finally, I have decided to use this money to invest in any profitable business in the country which is why this proposal is being kept under my control

A Justice Department database of foreign contracts found that US$7,600,000.00 (Seven million United States dollars) were paid to foreign firms in various contracts over the course of four years, which were executed under legitimate contracts executed under subcontracts by foreign firms. In total, the total contract value was US$9.9 million. In the case of the contracts executed under valid contracts executed under subcontracts, the actual contract value of US$9.9 million was paid to the foreign firms. In other words, US$7,600,000.00 (Seven million United States dollars) were paid to the contractors in all. In addition, the contract value of US$9.9 million was paid to foreign contractors in the course of which, the total sum paid to various foreign firms was US$8.2 million. This amount of US$7,600,000.00 is presently being kept in security file cabinet as a foreign contract, which we are now expatriating.\n This type of over-invoiced contracts has been in existence for over a decade, which is why we need your assistance to bring this under control and liquidate the contracts.

It will be my pleasure to assist in this transaction but you have to assure me that the above mentioned work is risk free and it will be executed under legitimate contracts executed under valid contract executed under subcontracts and your organization will receive the money on its course.

A man who escaped with the sum of $17.5million has been arrested in Luxembourg for allegedly plotting to buy out French oil firms and freeze their assets.The criminal code of conduct for a national of foreign currency was revealed by the investigation.The said money came from a bid by a consortium of foreign firms to acquire French oil firms in excess of US$16.5million. Now the man is being held in a security prison in Lome-Togo awaiting an arraignment.All the charges have been laid against the man and he is currently being held in the security prison where he is currently being held pending his hearing.The investigation into this individual is being carried out under the direct supervision of a security company in Lome-Togo.\r\nThis money came as a result of oil crises in Nigeria, Lesotho and Swaziland in the wake of general election results which saw the four major parties nominate for a second term. In line with this changed result, the coalition governments of 2000-03 and 2010-11 also saw a substantial reduction in the share of the traditional parties winning all elections.\r\nThese years have been particularly brutal for the traditional parties, as the opposition saw them as the last hope of rule and control of the country following the death of Prime Minister Charles Taylor.On November 6th, 2010, two suicide truck bombs went off in the Bangkok airport killing and injured many. In January this year a similar incident in Cannes, which resulted to the evacuation of a number of French and British citizens were also claimed.Following the death of Charles Taylor the country saw a massive refugee crisis, with as many as 8.7 million refugees now living in the European Union (EU) and the United States.In response to this problem, the governments of the United States of America and Canada have encouraged the importation of large amounts of crude oil and natural gas into the E.U.The major crude oil export market in the E.U. is Canada, which resulted to the introduction of new Petroleum royalty Act reauthorization on October 1, 2010.

Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.\nNow that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.

He died on April 3rd\nday, this is why I am contacting you for your assistance to\r\nclaim this money and release it to his family as the next of kin.\r\nHowever, I want you to stand as the next of kin of Mr. Joseph Joseph because I don't\r\nwant my late colleague's family members to receive\r\nthis money because of the political problems facing my country, the\r\nleaking of information about my colleagues when they died, and the\r\ndegree of people involved in the corrupt practices of the government\r\nin the country, which includes the government ministers, members of the opposition party in\r\nthe cabinet and some of the cabinet.\r\nTherefore, I want you to help the government of South Africa to get me\r\nout of the country, as I have been threatened to be kicked out by\r\npolitical opponents, which is what led to my arrest and seizure of\r\nportability hotel in Johannesburg, South Africa.\r\nI am desperately in need of your assistance, as the South African government\r\ntransfer settlement in my country into your account, pending\r\nfor your quickness and honesty in getting me out of this abode.\r\nKindly, acknowledge this letter by letter and let me know if

narrative.\r\nI am Barrister Greg Morris, a personal treasurer to the present President (PRESIDENT ROSE LUKE) of Liberia. The present\r\npresident, who is African National Hurricane Paul, has just declared a state of complete\r\nconfusion over the course of his presidency. He has just declared that the\r\ncountry has avoided a war and the country currently has no\r\nfighting ability. This man, who has nothing to do with the\r\ndiamond mining industry, is a fraud, an abject lunatic and an utter\r\ndoctor. He doesn't understand the need for a war, economic war, and\r\npolitical crisis in Liberia because he knows that war is the only viable\r\nworld order and that peace means survival in any area of\r\nmy family's existence. He is just another rich man who has no family\nmembers and do not know the difference between survival and\r\ngoesoes of war. Please, I want you to stand in as the next of kin of Mr.\r\nmy family, and assist us in investing the money in a wide\r\nnature of profitable ventures.

For this reason, I am contacting you now for your\r\nassistance and permission to\r\nmake the transfer transfer out to somebody else pending my arrival from a\r\njoint meeting of the World Economic Forum in Abuja, the recipient country of\r\nthe present financial and political instability.

Regrettably, there is an elementary crisis that is presently unfolding in Zimbabwe through what is called the 'West African Anti-Corruption operation' which is being carried out by the Zimbabwean ministry of labour and some private contractors. It is a very big problem that can be distinguished from it by the fact that Zimbabwean citizens and foreign contractors are using our country as political and economic prison and the economic and financial resources of Zimbabwe will be used in the same way as Zimbabwean citizens and foreign contractors.It is being carried out by the Federal Government of Zimbabwe (F.G.H.) and it is being carried out purposely to achieve the political objectives of the present Government.The present Government have decided to transfer some $9,000,000.00 million dollars (Nine million five hundred thousand dollars) from our Treasury to an overseas account with a Country of your choice, with the sum of $9,000,000.00 million in my possession.This money was never owned or controlled by any foreigner, all the directors of the Government were poachers of gem and diamond products and are in jail awaiting trial on charges of wire fraud.Dear friend, if this letter makes you feel right to contact you for this assistance, kindly reply.

The chairman of the Presidential Commission on human rights (CoOPER) Dr. Ramon Lagutin and a close confidant of late President Charles Taylor, was a victim of the land reform and land seizure Act of 1993 (Lanark-Act) which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some minority black farmers who had been receiving the money on the land for the past few years without any payment, with the pretext of helping the black farmers have a better life.\r\nFor over two years the farmers have been subjected to painful and protracted physical and physiological death while in the hospital. The death sentence handed down from the death sentence was handed down from the death sentence in the same jail. My government has continuously supported the farm owners in entrusting and investing in new and profitable farms and farm machinery farms and part of this assistance has been given to the President, who successfully resolved to end the land reform and land seizure Acts of 1993 which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some minority black farmers. The present government has not made any effort on the farm owners to come down to Britain and claim the money as unclaimed. Instead, the present Government has handed over the money to a security company and has been waiting for a long time for it to arrive. Government officials tell me that the money will be handed over to the security company for security reasons and then I will instruct the company to come down to England and claim it. I am now in London awaiting the arrival of the security company where the money is deposited.The present government has decided to eliminate all laws and regulations which protects the economic life of the farm owners and minority farmers and to remove all known restrictions on the movement of foreign account.\r\nThe present Government has decided to eliminate all forms of protection from the farmers and minority farmers in Britain and the United States of America, as well as Hong Kong and Taiwan.\r\nForeigners, especially American and Canadian expatriate are being targeted in a major way by the present government.

Preferred Exchange Street certificate from France.\nInternational bank and financial institutions have long complained about the  security features of the private banking sector, which they see as over invoiced deposit and as being subjected to laxity and over definitation by the government. The present Government is bent on making sure that the banking system is controlled and operated according to his ideology. In order to avert this kind of development, the present Government is embarking on this plan to eliminate all forms of private banking. In this regard, my colleagues and I have unanimously adopted a new proposal, which is to introduce a new tax on foreign remittances, to wit: a 10% tax on any amount deposited by foreign firms into our bank account.\nThis is an over invoiced deposit valued at US$15,000,000,000 (Thirty Five Million Dollars).\nIt is part of a long standing programme by the Government of the Netherlands to eliminate the middleman in the banking sector, and this is why we are contesting to claim this fund from the Bank of Netherlands West African.\nThe amount in question is a contract payment to a foreign firm which has been paid into our bank account. There is no risk involved, the transaction is 100% risk free. The legality of this transaction is established with no other person or entity having any knowledge about this transaction. The deposit amount at issue is US$15,000,000,000 (Thirty Five Million Dollars).\nThis tax is an over invoiced deposit valued at US$15,000,000,000 (Thirty Five Million Dollars).\nIf you are interested in this transaction, I would need to go into partnership with a foreign partner to secure the release of this fund to you after due deliberation and agreement from you. We have registered the interest of the foreign partners in placing order for the release of this fund, which can not be delayed.

A Federal Court has dismissed an application by a group of asylum seekers to have the bank transfer the money to their account in Dubai, south east of England. The appeal was lodged by the group seeking a remittance of money to an unknown country. The bank itself does not know the content of the money, hence the name of the customer. Based on the information gathered from the bank, the said customer, an Iraqi refugee, died in November last year while on a business trip to Dubai, in which his luggage was revealed to be containing treasure belonging to the late Iraqi president, U.S.AGL. Ahmed shafi`i. The appeal is pending in the Federal Court. I have contacted the bank to seek for a clarification of this matter but the application has been rejected on the grounds of the\nconfidentiality of the appeal application. I wish to let you know that all legal documents relating to the claim will be worked out and the claims will be transferred to your account for the claim. I have evaluated the claims and the ratio of trust between the parties and I would not want you to be involved. I am ready to give you 20% of the total sum for your partnership in this transaction, 5% will be mapped out for expenses and the remaining 70% will be for my family and I. 5% will be used to reimburse the management of the bank for all the efforts made by my family during the process of this transaction. 60% will be for me and my family. This transaction is 100% risk free. Finally, the bank will release the full deposit information to you upon your acceptance of this proposal. Let me hear from you as soon as possible.

Hence, this form of claiming does not comply with the principles laid down by the Korean Central Bank (KCB) and the Supreme People's Court of Korea. The law does not give refugee status to foreign deposits and forfeits the deposit must be forfeited. The South Korean government has made it very clear that if such deposit remains unclaimed for a long period of time, the money will be confiscated and deposited in an unserviceable account.

What the Helping Hand Did for Us?\r\nIn my search for a reliable and honest person to handle a very large and profitable conglomerate, I came to the conclusion that you can be of assistance in the following ways.\r\nFirst, just to concede your own wisdom and humanity, I will introduce myself as Mr. Aida Dunga, the Director of Corporate Finance with the bank. \r\nAs a matter of fact, I was the one who mandated that all directors in the bank immediately revert their shares back to the Government. This was done under the supervision of the head of the foreign affairs committee of the bank.We have frozen the assets of all directors in the bank with full reservation in respect to the above mentioned funds. You can find the full story at this website: http://newsfromrussia.com/main/2003/11/13/51215.html \r\nSecondly, just to excuse myself, I am seeking your absolute confidence in this transaction because of the risk it will take. All I have to do is instruct the Director in respect of the funds to revert the balance to the Government immediately. The Director have 14 days to give in to the Government. The balance of the funds has been shifted into a Bank account belonging to a foreigner, pending my time will come. I will then come over to meet with you.\r\nFinally, I would like to use this opportunity to introduce myself to you. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live.\r\nI have fought so hard to get in touch with anybody in this world, but as of now nobody has come to my assistance. I have therefore decided to reach out to any of the world's rich and well-connected people for a deal. This is called for is-for the fund.\r\nI have set aside 20% of this fund for you and for your time, and 40% will be for my family

It is urgent for me to use as a medium of transferring the money's remaining content from one country to another. The money was deposited in a security company and was duly secured with the help of a national company in Swaziland. I will be very glad if you can come over to my country to claim it.\r\nIn return for your assistance, the security firm will give you certain rights and privileges of the consignee, including the right to re-export the content to any country of your choice.\r\nI would like to make a business out of this successful deal, so that my family and I can continue the good life together. With your assistance, we can officially source for a reliable and trust-worthy foreign partner who will assist us in resuming the profitable business with you. The transaction is simple and risk-free.

The government of Liberia has unanimously approved a new agro-energy contract valued at US$21 Million,000.00 (Twenty-five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) to be executed under the lead of Contractor MR. FIEDI PETERSON. The contract is expected to be complete by the end of this year. A total contract value of US$21 Million,000.00 has been paid to Contractor MR. FIEDI PETERSON. The actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor. The original contractor who paid the original contractor will be entitled to the excess contract value. MR. PETERSON is a well-known oil consultant and oil merchant in the Republic of Liberia and his contract was with the Ministry of Oil and Gas and the Oil Robinsonines. He died in the year 2000 when rebel group U.N. peace keeping operation (PoM) was shocked and eliminate some oil deposits in Monrovia. Since then, the government of President Charles Taylor has mandated that all government chemical, biological and radiological DEXTERITY BILLS (THINGS)-being enforced by the U.N.-backed Government of President Charles Taylor, to be paid to Contractor MR. PETERSON. This amount is being rolled over and then be paid back to MR. PETERSON if nobody is found guilty of the charge. The money is being sent to the following countries under a different name: SOUTH AFRICA, NETHERLANDS, EUROPE AND Oceania.\nThe above figure was calculated from the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (ME) annual report of 2001. It shows that from October to December 2001 the THINGS bill were being paid to the Contractor MR. PETERSON. This was the first time that a contract payment has been sent to a Contractor without the original Contractor knowing about the Contract Payment.\nIn May 2003, the government of Liberia officially notified the Federal Government of Liberia that the contract has been concluded and the contract has been dormant with the Bank.\nAs a result of the current political crisis in my country,

We have\n amassed some funds amounting to millions of\n thousand united state dollars\n and intend to invest these funds in your country. Though we\n have been contacted by the bank to do business in your\n country, we are still members of the european union and\n as such we are not allowed to operate an account outside the\n european borders.

Part of the deal with the Russians is that we would get a 10% out of each transaction while the rest would be for me and my colleagues. This is a very lucrative business and it is a top priority of my government and our affiliate, so I will not sit on this and the others as the last of my kind.\r\nThere is a huge reward for this transaction and it is for the "I". The project is simple, clean and safe, and the money is safe. The first batch of this fund were generated by my colleague Mr. Mikhail Kalash in a vault computerized storage house in Ivano-Frankivost. The company is registered in Republic of Sierra-Leone and the project is planned to last for 30 years. All I want from you is to come over and facilitate the transfer of this fund to your account for onward investment and you will instruct the company to furnish you with the necessary information and the necessary procedures for the proper transfer of this fund.\r\nI apologize for using this medium to reach you, but this does not constitute an offer or an offer do not you accept. Please, let me be clear that this is not an offer and do not entertain any form of demurrage. I do not know of anybody in the world whom you could have a family investment in among the sum of  US$12 Million (12,000,000.00 Lancers) which you will hand over to me as a family member. This money was inherited from my late husband. It was the result of a contract and Machinery Factory that was not profitable and over-inflated the produce. My husband unfortunately died from ill health before the death of his long time partner and also was the victim of a land dispute in Zimbabwe. I have immunity from prosecution in respect of this contract and this is the original\r\nwritten agreement.\r\nYou have been adviced to keep this fund in your private or company account for investment as the bank of Zimbabwe and Government account will be revealed.

====================
Canada's oil industry has been saddled with heavy duty duties of the federal government since 2005.\r\n In June this year, the federal government proposed to lift all restrictions on foreign oil and gas exploration and production on our coast. In May this year, a tsunami devastated the area causing a lot of farm destroyed and liveslots of people.\r\n On October 18th 2005, unknown persons (D.E.O.) and three other persons (A.N.G.)who had just made claims to the sum of $12.5million (Eighteen Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) were among the few who were killed in the tsunami. The cause of death has not been made known to anybody except the officials of the coastguard and the officials are in hiding. Now the situation is changing and the government is seriously considering lifting all restrictions on foreign investment in our oil and gas production area.\r\n This proposal from the federal government to lift all restrictions on foreign oil exploration and production on our coast has not been carried out and the regulations in force at the time of the deposit are being in force. This entire incident will not be able to be successfully accomplished because the government is not aware of the existence of any body or persons claiming the deposit.\r\n With the current situation, and with the looming threat of a possible oil wealth and unstable monetary policy, it would not be prudent for the federal government to keep all the banking and investment restrictions in place. As a result of the current situation, it is not possible for us to open any bank account in Canada and as such we cannot operate any account in this country. Hence we are constrained to rely on foreign firms to manage our deposits and deposits. We are faced with the dilemma of depositing our money in a foreign country which we can not access or receiving our money in a bank account in Taiwan, as we are not allowed to operate an account in Canada.\r\n This is why we are making this contact to seek for an assistance from you. We are seeking your assistance to have your name appear

I know you will be surprised to read from me,\nHowever, I would like to introduce my self to you. I am Daniel Terra,a Muscovite, a son of late Dr.Roland Terra (First Minister of Congo-Kinshasha) of Zaire. My father died on October 6th 1994 during a goodwill visit to the town of Zaire by the President Charles Taylor who visited the village of Zaire asking for peace and co-existence and blessed is he who serve the country the laws and the order.\nThis was the first goodwill visit I made to the country. I am sorry but I do not intend to offend anyone. I left a very big sum of money (US$30.5M)with my late father. This money was deposited in an abandoned structure in my country DAKAR, SOUTH AFRICA under the custody of a private security firm. Before his death I was the Deputy Minister of Finance in the President Charles Taylor Government. My father was accused of Murder and Insurgency for the 15-year period of his government, until his death. Before his death, the total sum of money was deposited in a security safe box in my name in my NAME as Deputy Minister of Finance in the President Charles Taylor Government. Now the security company has declared my father's death as a murder.\nAccording to the law, upon maturity, the next of kin or relation of the deceased shall stand as the next of kin to the deceased owner of the fund. Such names as mine are due to be named next of kin. The Security company feels confident associating the fund with me because of the deceased status.\nThat being said, I have been mandated by the ruling government to look for a reliable foreign partner to present as Next of Kin for the deceased since I am a refugee. The source of the fund to present itself as Next of Kin for the deceased is as a paid service to the Government of my country. I am therefore seeking your consent to present you as Next of Kin to the deceased so that the funds can be rem

I got your information from one of the customers who used to work with the company and was interested in knowing about the luggage that is left behind by the duke of kensington before he died.\nUpon receiving this information, I immediately went into communication with the company. I would not want you to contact me directly concerning any of this luggage because this luggage \nhas been abandoned by his family.\nHowever, I have the power to change the ownership of any luggage that is abandoned within the next 5 working days. You will be given 8 calendar days to do so.  If you agree to do this, I will offer you 20% of the total amount as compensation for your effort/input after the 8 working days. I will also issue you an email address so that the company will send you the copy of the certificate of deposit that was issued to the firm when the luggage was abandoned on the behalf of the duke of kensington.\nI strongly believe that by doing this, you would be able to save the lives of the Duke of kensington and his family since nobody will ever know that the contents of the consignment had been deposited by a foreigner while he was on official government business.  I would also be able to stop his family from ever again changing out the contents of the consignment. The entire contents of the consignment was discovered when the Duke of kensington was on official business and he was found guilty of this crime.\nI do not want this family to go through the soul searching for the content of this consignment and I therefore making this contact to you.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm\nSome years ago, the German government introduced a new monetary policy targeting financial institutions with strict monetary controls. The main objective of this new monetary policy was to introduce a new system of sharing of wealth distribution which, for the first time ever, allowed both the rich and the poor to exercise different kinds of personal and/or investment based on their actual need for this assistance. This move by the federal government to introduce a new monetary policy targetting financial institutions with strict monetary controls was a surprise, as the Economic and Monetary Analysis (EMA) of December 30th, 2002, which was in effect at the time, showed that the base rate of interest for 25 calendar months (12.5 % of 10 year) was 7.26 %, the rate of 4 yrs/month was 7.21 % and the balance of 35.9 million British pounds was deposited.\nUnfortunately, the new monetary policy was not met, as the government account balance of 46 million British pounds was opened and the banking system was totally frozen.\nThe depositors were then able to withdraw the money from the bank, leaving behind a huge sum of money which they wished to transfer to a foreign account they may wish to establish before the new monetary policy was introduced.\nThe bank officials then contacted my Attorney and informed him that the funds had to be packaged and shipped to a foreign country. Hence, I had to negotiate with the officials in the following ways:-\n-I. The director of the bank would first inform the bank president that the consignment would need to be packaged and shipped to a foreign address, which the director will explain to him.\n-II. The consignment would be shipped to the address in question and the director would inform the consignment's manager in the Department of Finance and he would then come down to meet with me to finalize the arrangement in the Department of Finance and the directors of the bank would then make a final determination on the amount of
