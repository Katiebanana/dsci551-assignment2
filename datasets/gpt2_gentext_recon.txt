Ken Quattara, 52, of South Africa was arrested in December last year for his involvement in the financing of the Five Million Dollar loan (Forty Five Million Dollar) with his brother Ken Quattara. In November 2000, ten months ago, Ken Quattara, who was finance officer of Continental Bank of Nigeria, made an agreement with his Finance House Nigeria Deposit Nigeria Account to a finance company of which he made a subsea deposit of the Thirty Five Million Dollar bound for the Finance House Nigeria account. This was not the intended purpose of the deposit but was a misunderstanding as to the method of the the the shipment according to which the Thirty Five Million Dollar would be released to the Finance House Nigeria account pending after the Finance House Nigeria account for sharing the deposit.  However, as the Finance House Nigeria official stated, the content of the consignment was Dollars ($25) Million US Dollars and the last five Hundred Thousand Thousand United States Dollars deposited into the Finance House Nigeria account.  This is the actual reason why it was a political will to let the Five Million Dollar floating for the Finance House Nigeria account be released to Mr. Quattara. Mr. Quattara did not declare the content of the consignment in the House till late March this year this year the deposit into the account.  The Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) had on his letter of the deposit, but the agency had finally decided to hear from him on the deposit as his next of kin. So the FOMC has decided that the sum of $25 million USD be paid to Mr. Quattara as unclaimed bill.  The FOMC's foreign remittance policy is very strict and must be respected.

The documents that was finally \r\nreleased to the security company by the Director of National \r\nRemuneration in charge of the security company were used in the transaction, hence the \r\nclaim.\r\nOn the positive side, the success of the operation is partly due to the fact that the security company \r\nwas able to use \r\nthe money in our collections to settle any claims that might be made by either party, as the \r\nbeneficiary or possessor of the funds to whom the consignment was entitled. Though, in \r\nour opinion, the security company was not aware that the \r\nleft over boxes left over from the trade show upon the consignment were still \r\nwith us and copy protection was also provided by us to the company to \r\nprotect the content from theft or seizure by the security company. Hence, the success \r\nof the operation. As the director of national remuneration, I am well aware that the \r\nwork of a \r\nsuccessful and dedicated person like you is something that will never be easily neglued out of \r\nan account by any means down the road. Therefore, I made available to me by /\r\nmy colleagues the names and contact of an accredited foreign partner that \r\nhas about hand over the consignment to our custody pending when the London-based \r\ntrust attorney will contact you to assist in the transaction.\

I am a solicitor to Mr. Abraham Dreyfus, a citizen of Zimbabwe and we are the two men behind the recent black money run up in our country.  I have arrested the two men linked up and some other officials including clearing money from the treasury department of the treasury in Zimbabwe.  However, the amount of money in question is still in question and the officials involved have been expelling the money from the treasury for some time without a single found, hence the whole matter.  This has  raised     a lot of    really big questions in my mind as to why  the  officials  should be

I want to present you as the next of kin of the deceased  my father who was  able to transfer some funds left behind by my mother when they were lying in a cruise ship marina after the crash. I want to state that these funds were paid to me by the foreign account holder and that are now being claimed by my family the funds have been paid to the foreign account holder.\nHowever, my mother and father have both passed away, so the financial and moral standing of our society is not very.\nTherefore, I seek for your immediate and unconditional assistance to my family and to both myself and my family's in the country so that we should be able to invest the funds in your country, because the political situation there is very bad because the president is in power and the people are not very disposed to back him up. I & my family are staying in Spain where we can still pursue a life outside the country due to the

The money will be paid to my\r\nnominee by the money weave into the document to enable the bank to process the claim.\r\nHowever, the conditions under which this money was deposited is reprehensible,the law here is against insider trading and I am only an\r\nExecutive Accountant with the Bank. This is the actual reason why I was\r\nin charge of the deposit of the fund in the correspondent vault of the Bank and the law here is even\r\nagainst it. The condition of our deceased client is that the said amount be paid to the overseas\r\naccount of our late clients, the former oil consultant and oil minister of our oil producing republic of\r\naherjan cote}ez-Tout, but the bank cannot release the money to the former client because the\r\ncontractor has expired and the account operator has left.\r\nThis is why we have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be\r\nvery beneficial to both of us\r\nand the purpose of this letter is to solicit your assistance in transfering this money out\r\nyou will invest in your future for the propagation of my idea and for the\r\nreputation of the world that you will act as the "next of kin" to the aforementioned Mr.\r\nMikhail Khodorkovsky because he left the Government and\r\ndied as a result of his involvement in politics in May this year this\r\nprovision, the information about his death was made available to the\r\ndomain about him by my late client,s lawyer and we dont want\r\

A couple who tried to solicit for my husband's murder-suicide have been rewarded with 14 million dollars in the bank!

Mr. Ziya Bazila and Mrs.Ricardo Obiang Obiang Bank here in Bangkok, are well-known for their outstanding service to the people of Africa.  They were awarded the title of "Best Shrunken wife" by the Government of South Africa in 1999.  Since then, their husbands death, they have been unable to come forward to lay claim to this funds and all attempts at locating relatives for this funds has been fruitless.  After the death of their husband, they moved the funds to a designated account overseas.But because of the war crisis in Africa,  the government of South Africa have refused to release the last two million dollars in 2001.  The funds have been floating in the hope of being retrieved but, unfortunately, the money was never retrieved and no one has ever come forward to claim the funds.  Now, I am seeking for your assistance to claim the funds from Pretoria where the deceased deposited it.  The money is still lying in the Bank and the account holder has neither come forward to claim the funds nor can anyone come forward to do so.  The owner of the money is Mr. Charles Taylor an American and great industrialist and a resident of Africa.  The owner of the money is of African origin and the funds were not registered with the South Africa Government Corporation.  The South Africa Government have made several unsuccessful attempts to trace his family members account all attempts has been fruitless.  The owner therefore, has decided to now seek for the assistance of a foreigner (a foreigner who can stand as his legal representative) to the Bank to claim the funds from the bank.  The owner of the account has no foreign beneficiary and the transaction has been secretly taken and finalised.\nHowever, my proposal is that I would like you to be the ultimate beneficiary of the funds and the first and the only person who will not support any form of theft of the funds.

As he was a contractor with the \r\nNDA during the payment of the war, I discovered that he died in the\r\narration and the fund has been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in his \r\nCustody either from his family or relation before my discovery to this \r\ndevelopment.\r\nTo summarise the story, my father deposited the sum of US$9M.\r\nIn my punially titled "Security deposit" in a finance/security company in Europe.\r\nI of course  contacted you to assist me in disbursement of this fund by your\r\nAccount into a\r\nsecurity account from the company to be used for the security of the fund.

This product was packaged in a sealed box and had a slipcase containing a total of Eight trunk hard-cases with numbered hard-case covers. The hard-cases contained over fifty million Dollars in cash. The trunk covers were in a condition worth Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars. The security company that packaged the product has since passed away.\r\nThis business is not limited to the United States, but Any Country you may wish to proceed with. I will like to know if you are interested in this deal, so I will need your name, address, passport number to be forward for the investment transaction.\r\nI will like to know the total sum of $5.2\r\nMillion Dollars in cash in a hard-case copy of this Confidential Certificate attached to the above trunk case. Can you be of assistance?\r\nConsider this proposal of mutual benefit. My father came from nothing to work in this company, and he never heard of us before he discovered I work in this company. He then ran away with the sum of $5.2 million Dollars to Hong Kong, where he is now seeking refuge. He has the documents with the deposit box at my father's request which he deposited with a security company in Europe for safe keeping. I am just 18 years old and a university undergraduate. I am really embarrassed at the unbelievable expenses that have been put on my father's back by my father, but I am determined to go ahead and work with you as soon as possible. If you can be of assistance by this, then I will be very grateful. I am just 18 years old and a university undergraduate and really want to help out a personal person, so I will like to know the total amount involved in the transaction, because I don't know anything about this company this company or the sales process, I just know I can get away with it because I am from a country of origin.\r\nI am just 18 years old and a university undergraduate and really want to help out a personal person, so I will like to know the total amount involved in the transaction, because I don't know anything about this company this company or the sales process, I just know I can

PHILADELPHIA -- It's official: You are one step closer to the ultimate goal of building a better world.With the development of online services, I have in my possession some confidential US Dollars which I intend to transfer abroad with the assistance of a foreign company.This money was deposited as a consignment with a long dormant account in a Finance/Security Company in Europe. I have decided to seek foreign partner to carry out this great financial transaction which will be of benefit to both of us.\r\nThe nature of the company is not disclosed to me, hence, I am not permitted to appear in front of a grand jury or the foreign media unless specifically told otherwise.\r\nI am the manager of  the US$50.5M\r\nConsignment (Twenty Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) when the funds were deposited with French Security Company. My department came to notice after going through several file boxes that some of the fund was missing. These boxes have since been \r\ndeposited and the fund is now in the suspense account of the Finance and security company.\r\nI am currently in Europe to further settle this fund overseas and to set up a family-business abroad. As it is, this fund has already been deposited and is likely to be transferred \r\nout of the country into a secured security company for subsequent\r\nfurther disbursement.\r\nAs the manager to a deceased customer since 2001, I have decided that I cannot be involved in the future\r\narrivelling up the funds as the manager to a deceased customer because the relation is coming back\r\nagain, I am assassinated at the last moment of my\r\nresponsibility after a protracted search for a relaible and trust worthy person.\r\n_________________________________________________________________\r\nFREE BET On Your Further\r\nProceeds Transaction Log To My e-\r\n e-MAIL  f_baramoz@yahoo.ca\r\n

I am the manager of Global Witness  NGO in Liberia. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 4, 2003, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the same name, went by the name Iraqi and he left an Ammittobi-PBSD deposit with a box code AMNHANDG007 in an account in a finance/security company in south africa.\nAccording to the company policy, all bank account names/names should be interpreted with caution. According to this policy, if the suspected beneficiary is a foreigner, the company will discard the suspected beneficiary's foreign beneficiary consent when the next of kin or relative of the suspected beneficiary applies for the said deposit. The said amount was US$423,000,000.00 (Fourteen Million Dollars Only).\nAs it turned out, the company did not declare the account in South Africa as his until after the death of the supposed beneficiary. This indicated that the suspected beneficiary has been identified as Iraqi.\nI took this information and mapped out a course for the money to Kuwait or any of the Gulf Arab oil producing countries. The course was, "US$423,000,000.00 (Fourteen Million Dollars Only)", "US$43,000,000.00 (Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars Only)", "US$129,000,000.00 (Seventeen Million Dollars Only)", "US$189,000,000.00 (Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars Only)", "US$234,000,000.00 (Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars Only)", "US$296,000,000.00 (Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars Only)", "" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not aware of any other beneficiary of this account, and I am not aware of any family or friends that helped the Iraqi. I contacted you because I think it is very important to locate any of our late client's extended family or friends. I need your assistance in securing the money and property of my client, I have two options; 1) Upon request of my client, \r\nThe above mentioned amount be paid to any reliable foreign partner that will supply the required funds; \r\

The circumstances surrounding his death has left me \r\nin a huff of hoot, in order to locate any of my colleagues who may be of assistance\r\nso that  I may use the money  to fund my political campaign in   Federal Republic of Togo,  hence I \r\ndeposited this letter in my possession for our political  process.  The circumstances surrounding  my  letter of assistance  were  as follows:  It came as a result of a \r\nfailure to file official report in at least 6 months, either as a result of ignorance, \r\nluck, or because of poor health. The former minister of finance did not file his personal \r\nreport because he fears for his life.  As a result, I have decided to seek a foreign partner with \r\nrespect to carry out  my political mission . I am contacting you based on \r\nthis as your partner because while I can  assist you to achieve my mission successfully, \r\nin the event of an \r\nunsuccessful operation on my behalf, we can still work together on this transaction.\r\nI am contacting you based on concern for your  welfare as a result of this transaction because I \r\ncan not yet confidently go into business alone, as my partners have advised me that the \r\nsuccess of my proposition will depend on your nature and the success of my project.\r\nI want to assure you that you will be highly rewarded for your assistance both in \r\nterms of your time and resources involved.

I am contacting you based on an \r\ninsight into some of the serious problem in the family. My colleagues at the high court and \r\na judiciary are seizing on this as an indication that the Government is moving in a very serious direction and intend to execute a \r\nof their political war declaration on the country on the 19th of May. This is because the law of Netherlands prohibits an individual or a company to stand any claim to the same \r\nproperty for the same purpose as posing a threat to the stability and future of the state. The present state of the affairs in the state of West Germany particularly the fact that the federal government has taken over several public and private properties including many government owned. All these have been seized on by the Government as political war zones. In light of this, I write you urgently to request for your assistance and also to find a way of getting this money out of the country as it is being seized on by the security and political parties in Europe and America.  However, it is my conviction that the entire arrangement being placed before you (NGO/partners or an allied foreign partner) to claim this money is an offence under the code of conduct of the Country and that you shall be held to a higher code of conduct (Art.) for the time being. According to the laws of the country, at the end of each fiscal of fiscal year 2002 in which at least one quarter (US$1,700,000.00) is remaining unclaimed after expiry of 5 years, the money will revert

The Hong Kong Government on Monday extended the period of "security remittances" that has been in effect since 1999 to three years, with the help of foreign contractors, to be entitled "Senior Management Account" or JAM. The Finance Ministry on Monday made available to the public the text of the former treasurer, who was the main contractor who finally recovered the money and deposited it in a private security vault in a Government Bank, for security reasons. The Finance Ministry also provided us with copies of the last and the certificate of deposit for the security deposit in the account. The request of a foreign contractor to carry out the transaction was not allowed by us and we had to come down here to perform the transaction ourselves. The request was made with our own efforts, because we are not allowed to operate a foreign account.\r\n According to the Hong Kong Law, a foreign contractor must employ a person that is also a contractor to carry out the said contract.

Why I Need Your Assistance .......................................\r\nI am Mr. Tutu  a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources . Recently, I discovered a floating fund deposited by a Foreigner , who died in the recent Anti-government Square Movement in Tel-Aviv Square in Kiev, Ukraine. This fund was allegedly deposited by a Turkish Man with Witness Protection, with the help of a United Nation sanctioned Law Enforcement Agency (LEA) over a period of several years. The Law Enforcement Agency recovered a huge sum of money valued at U.S. Dollars (Thirty Six Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only). From the laws and guidline of the country, the deceased had an Immigrant Resident , who \r\ndeposited the fund on behalf of his Family . The family has three children including the only fiddle prodigy (who is now late) who is now with a cousin in Europe. \r\nThe deceased migrated to the United States from Africa a while back and my late late F.O.J asked if we could come over to your country for our last tune-up after our payment is confirmed. \r\nWe discovered from the Law enforcers that the deposit of the fund ($26.5m. Two Hundred And Twenty Thousand United States Dollars only) was made by a foreigner with a Law Enforcement Agence . \r\nThe money has been floating for the last three months and we are still not getting any response back home. \r\nI am convinced that a long-term arrangement has been struck down between both parties and the funds will be released to you as soon as you agree to the arrangement and you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum, 60% will be for us and 5% will be for taxation and miscellaneous expenses, the rest we shall jointly and severally share in the procompitation fund for the pro-hoc investments in the country. \r\nI will confidentially send your name and address to the above identified person for further action. Please my trust is your last, as personal and\r\nconfidential.\r

I write you this mail in good faith, hoping that it will be of mutual benefit to you and your family. My name is John Paul Watson an orphan, born and raised in a refugee camp in Zimbabwe. \nOn the 20th of June 1998, my father was murdered by government agents in my country Zaire for no legitimate reasons. Now that his body has come out, I am following all proper procedures to \nthe death of my father. My investigation proved to me that nobody else is coming for my father though he did \nreceiving TONS of money in Liberia, as he was the last of the last of the people to escape Zimbabwe, I also discovered that his four brothers \nalso happen to be from that country, so I\ndiscovered that his father also kept a lot of personal effects of the currency \nmoney in a security vault in my name.\nThe reason I am asking for your assistance and the money for which he was \ndunceremoniously de-mapped to the original country of birth for no apparent security reason is \nbecause I don't have a family outside Africa.\nMy only wish is to visit Liberia as soon as possible, but I don't have a destination yet, I \nneed your company/partners to invest the money in a business of this nature e.g. a \nresident investment or a business of your own, because at the moment the money \nfund is being invested by foreign contractors who come and do business with \nmy name as their beneficiary but unfortunately all the money belongs to one foreigner, so \nI kept the content to myself because I don't want a situation where \nthis money will be used in an \nabominable manner, hence the reasons for taking this bold decision. I am only 24 years now ,and \nmeeting my dreams I am standing here with you, I don't know if I \nneed a second life, I don't know where I am going to be, I don't know what I will do \nself, I don't know what I want to do, I just want to live my life my way of life \nand never give out.

I needed a way to transfer this money out of South Africa for investment purpose. Since this money is private and untraceable, it is highly secured and can only be claimed by a foreigner. Third party depositors are not covered and will not come to the security company if they do not wish to use the company for investment purpose. Therefore, I made further investigation, discovered that the account holder is a foreigner and a Burkinabé cannot materialise as he/she wished.\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\

I am a manager in the  \nforeign remittance department  of a bank here in Abidjan, a country that \nrenews our donation every three months. The bank  official  told me \nthat as soon as the fund gets transferred to their bank  account in cotonou, johar \nwardele, \nthat the bank will refund  us the sum of  US$6,000,000.00 (twenty-seven \nmillion United State Dollars only)  from  it for us. \nUnfortunately, during the current political war in  my country  the \nbank  official  finally told me that I would have to wait until after \nthe elections to claim the seats in the  bank  account of  jejor immunity from here  to  africa so \nthat  they could issue my application for the claim of the account, because I already \nin the present administration have  made several inquiries to the bank to claim the \nbalance,  none has worked  hard enough to come to  my aid. \nAfter
