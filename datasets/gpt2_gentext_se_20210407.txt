WELCOME TO ASYLUM.COM\r\nCONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL\r\nAttention Please,\r\nI am Mrs. Maryam Hussein, the widow of the late Nigerian president, General Sani Abacha. On the 25th of December 2003, an American businessman, and his wife, Mrs. Maryam Hussein, made a numbered time (Fixed deposit) for twelve calendar months, valued at US$12,500,000.00, (TEL) (Dollars) two Million United States Dollars, in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent an email to their  contact for further action. Twenty one copies of my email were forwarded to them. I did not disclose the copy to them because I do not want them to know about my husband\'s contribution to this country. This is because\r\nI do not want to be exposed as a corrupt government official. I also do not want them to know about my husband\'s investment in the Oil Industry in my country. I therefore made several\r\nconfidential phone calls to these contacts in order to obtain any information which will aid in the transfer of the money\r\nthus implicating my husband\'s interest abroad into a Bank Account overseas which my husband acquired through a partnership business with a Swiss bank.\r\nI did not disclose to them the amount in the deposit before but they did NOT inform my husband. I now seek the consent of the directors of the Swiss Bank to\r\nrelease the deposit to you for safe keeping upon your good behavior in this transaction.\r\nThis transaction can have no doubt whatsoever as to the legality of the fund, as every document of\r\nfund transaction is on the safe keeping and sharing of funds in accordance with Bank\'s guidelines. Please I want you to provide\r\nyou will be able to provide a foreign Account for the Deposit.\r\nI will furnish you with all the relevant documents which will help you understand what I am going to propose.\r\nFederal Bank of Nigeria policy forbids us from revealing foreign Account to secure the deposit.

President Hassan Rohani, who is now in jail following the death of late Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, has and released ten million US dollars from his bank account, which was valued at US $40 Million US Dollars.\r\nThe fund has been deposited in a security company here, and will be released when the security company finds the money and gives it to the family.\r\nNo other person knows about this fund, the owner of the security company is a foreigner, a foreigner too, and no one knows about this fund. The family is very uneasy about this fund, as the security company has not called for it either, as the family is very concerned over the fund, as they are afraid of the leaking of the money to the media. The family is very much in fear of the money, as the new leader of the new Liberia and Sierra Leone Government, Dr.Sesay Abacha, is on trial for his involvement in financing and financing the (former) Liberian rebels. The family is very much in fear of lying this fund to any person or company for fear of both their lives and the life of the family if he does not call for it. The family is presently staying in a refugee camp here in Adra while the security company is locating the family here, as the family is very much in fear of leaking this money to the media.

OBJECTIVE: I am Carol Greenberg-Hall, I work in the Technical Department of the Private Equity Institute of the University of South Africa, Johannesburg. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On February 13th, 1999, a British national, Mr.JAMES DAVID, made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$18, 000,000.00, (Eighteen Million, five hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in my bank. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month and a half, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Federal Government that Mr.David Li, a foreigner, died from an automobile accident.On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.David Li, a foreigner, has a British passport number which means that he did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum of US$18, 000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank, and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 years, the money will revert to the ownership of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the deposit. This is a serious and very concerning development.As a result of this serious situation, I decided to come forward and claim the deposit from the deceased because, I am not allowed by South African Government to operate any account outside South Africa. This is an extraordinarily serious and very concerning development, as I have been mandated in my duties as a Civil Servant by the South African Government, to look for foreign Relatives or Relatives of the deceased that will assist in the transfer of the money from my Bank to their account. This is exactly what I did. I used my position in my bank to get in touch with some of the deceased relatives other than Mr.David Li. After sending the

This year's presidential election was held in May 1998. The incumbent President, Mr. Jose Eduardo Dos Santos defeated me by 4.6 million votes. In his first four months in office, he made a total of 29,036,000,000.00 (Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). This was a total political money which could not be approved to any foreigner, but could easily be approved to any foreigner under the guise that hew to his beliefs, or his family. This has made it practically impossible for any foreigner to get onto his financial affairs. This sum has made me to crave for a foreigner to help me (confer my share)I have worked hard to earn this sum,but I cannot earn it without further suffering the pains of seclusion and poverty. I prefer to live my life as a free and prosperous person (and let nobody oppress me). I have no child except my twond son that will inherit this money. I have set aside 25% for you and for your time.

The customer was a foreigner fromPakistan and i deposited his Bank Deposit in a finance with a finance company abroad as a \nforeign customer.\nHowever, after his death, my bank officials asked me to look for a foreign partner overseas to transfer the money into, and transfer it into a foreign account since we have not met or met face to face.\nIn view of this, i had in my Bank Ourselves ready to conclude a transfer of this money to the account of the Central Bank of Pakistan (CBN) to avoid confusion with foreign customers. As such, i did not know that this money was still in the account of the Central Bank of Pakistan.The reason why i am writing you is that this money (9 Million, nine hundred thousand Dollars)was deposited with the finance company, then a foreign customer of my late client's deposited the money with us.\nMore so, the Central Bank of Pakistan does not know about this money, because it was a\nbusiness transaction, and the transaction was registered under the Name of the customer.\nIn view of this, i should have provided you with the name of the person that deposited the money with us but it is not my name,\nbecause the finance company does not know anything about this money, and the money was deposited with me.\nThis is why it is important for you to know that this transaction is so expensive and time consuming.\nWith my position in the position now, i can transfer this money to any believing person that will assist us in transferring this money out of Pakistan. This is why i contacted you to assist us in transferring this money out of Pakistan through a foreign account, and we want you to stand in as the beneficiary to this\nproceeding from the contact of the finance company, and send

The Baghdad Government seem bent on seizing our money and if we do not surrender to them, they will declare our debts and the interest collected as unclaimed.\nThe situation is quite ripe for a coup d'etat. I have in my possession an overdue payment for a contract executed by my company, and in order to avert this fate, I want you to stand on our behalf to receive this fund. I have mapped out three-quarter million, Five hundred thousand United States dollars (USD$3,500K) in 8\nTreasury bills.\nThe amount involved is ($2,500,000.00) US dollars.

I am contacting you in respect of a cash reward in my bank for your assistance in this transaction.\r\nOn the 4th of October 1999, a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr.William Horry, made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$20,000,000.00 (Twenty-Fifty Five Million Dollars). Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.\r\nAfter a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation that Mr.William Horry died in (Monday, 8th October 1999) with his wife, and all his property had been confiscated by the Nigerian military Government. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.\r\nI therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.William Horry did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20,000,000.00 was secretly moved from my bank to BISELESS ACCOUNT by an American firm, that Mr.Peter Morris, the only son of Mr.Joseph Morris.\r\nMr.Peter Morris, the only son of Mr.Joseph Morris, the only son of the late Mr.Edward Morris, was a British Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.

PROPOSAL OF NATIONALITY FOR FOREIGN INVESTMENT/PROMOTION OF FOREIGN SERVANTS IN EUROPE.\r\nI am Dr. M.ENAPOLIS OGO, the only son of Late President Laurent Gambo of Liberia. During the peak of crisis in my country, which lasted for more than two years, my father drove all his motorbikes into an empty lot in the town of Lampou.\r\nHe left the documents for the deposit with a security company. After the evacuation of the town, the security company came to inform me of a reliable foreigner who had left for Europe with the sum of US$27.2 million. Upon this information, I immediately sought for someone who will assist me in making a claim of the fund from the Security Company here in Lampou, and then transfer this money to his country.\r\nMy company here in Lampou has a security center on premises and I have been given the most urgent and lucrative business opportunity to establish a "Foreign Investment/PROMOTION/PROMOTION" in Niger. The money which my father deposited with the security company is still with us and with the security company. We have been given the power to transfer the money abroad with the help of a foreign firm. This is what I have decided to do.\r\nI have the courage to ask for your assistance in getting a reliable foreigner to help me transfer this fund into his country which shall be\r\ngenerate upon my arrival here in Europe. I have agreed to offer you 30% of the total amount for your assistance and 5% shall be set aside to cover any expenses that may be incurred by you during the course of this transaction.\r\nThis transaction is 100% risk free and the money will be secured in a safe safe account which you shall provide. Whichever the account you shall provide, the money will be deposited in your account by me.

I am in agreement that your time is not more your time and I would like to invest this money for my country. I am in no condition to think of any form of actual foreign investment as I know very much that it will be most profitable for my country if you will not stand.  This is simply because I do not have the money and ability to make any use of it honestly and honestly.  I do know that if I do not invest this money into real estate and industrial projects, my country will be in a very bad condition.  I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner.  I want peace and security for my people.  I do not want anyone suspected of any violent crime.

The current framework of international trade deals, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership, has encouraged other countries to cheat as well, and executed by some countries in Africa against the wishes of some governments, some in Asia. That is why it is of great interest to consignment of international trade deals should provide a more profitable alternative to existing international deals.

That is why we are seeking your assistance to the release of the funds, and a prompt and prompt transfer of such funds to you as a result. For this purpose, you will be compensated with 10% of the total sum, 60% will be used for the expenses incurred in the process of transferring the funds, while 5% will be set aside to take care of miscellaneous expenses that may arise during the course of the process of transferring the funds.

A couple of days ago, I got your contact details through the local Chamber of Commerce and Industry,who is assisting in the transfer of funds and said that they want you to come to their country for investment as you would help the family on behalf of the family. I agreed to offer you 20% of the total amount for your assistance, while 10% shall be set aside for expenses that may arise during the transaction. I did not forget your suggestions and decided to engage in this transaction with you.\r\nI will use my position to make a good investment in your country. This will be based on my position as the Banking President/C.E.O of one Of the prime bank of On\r\nMember banks of European Union. This business proposal should be treated with utmost secrecy, as it may be\r\nconfidential. Also, you understand that my private bank accounts have been frozen by the Nigeria Federal\r\nGovernment.\r\nDue to this situation, I cannot give you more details as I have already\r\ndecided not to discuss the matter further, as I am afraid of a\r\nJihadist attack. Please remain confident during this\r\nsouth crisis in my country. In view of this, I finalized\r\nthis proposal with my Chief Financial Adviser, who is\r\na member of the Kenya Peace Council.\r\nTherefore, I need your urgent attention. In due process I\r\nmade arrangements with my attorney to get an attorney to act as the\r\nnext of kin to Mrs. Elizabeth F.

When it comes to properties, you can usually negotiate in terms of royalty/interest as long as the agent is a foreigner, this will not affect your royalty/interest rate. Also, your company stock is highly tradable, usually in US Dollar and euro. Remember, to a great extent, repatriation is hard and expensive, as you will need a reliable foreign partner or foreign company to repatriate the money.\r\nThere are some companies abroad which offer premium services for the sole purpose of collecting taxes and operating foreign accounts.\r\nThese companies are highly profitable, they also offer better interest rate than the companies in question. There is no risk involved because you are not a foreigner. Just ask them for assistance.\r\nIf you are interested, please reply immediately via the email address below.

The insurance company is now assuring us that the deceased remains dead still , and with the help of the firm, the beneficiary has claim of the fund and transfer of this fund to an account being maintained by the deceased to avoid any trace of the deceased.The information was relayed to the security firm by a potential foreign partner who wished to invest his money here.It would not be surprising if this information was relayed to the security firm with the intention of getting the beneficiary for future transfer of the fund, but they proved to be untrustworthy as they did not know anything about this company.As a result, the security firm knew that this deceased customer would die, hence the mode of death information was relayed to them.This amount of US7.5 million is still in the security firm's account and my\r\ncolleagues and I are on a search for a reliable foreign partner to assist us in safely transferring this fund out of South Africa to any foreigner in the world.\r\nWe are waiting for the receipt of the\r\ninformation.\r\nPlease if you find a reliable person to assist us, we urge you to contact him so that we can apply for a new account as the beneficiary of the fund.\r\nYour role is as the agent incharge of securing the funds, ensuring that the\r\nsecurity company knows that this fund is in the custody of the deceased, and ensuring that the\r\nfund is transferred to a foreign account as his only beneficiary for onward sharing of the\r\nfund.\r\nReceiving this letter from the security firm is an act of humility.

Based on recent developments in my country, I decided to acquire a foreign company in respect to the investment of these funds into real estate and industrial production. This is the situation. I was a top executive in the Ministry of Petroleum Resources when the money was still outstanding. Having watched with great surprise as my contract was concluded, I now know that it is safe to say that I will never again operate a foreign company.\r\nI have packaged all the documents of the money, and intend to issue a letter of authority to all concerned officials upon their receipt of the said funds which I will send to you with a copy of this letter to you when you reply.
